Antigua and Barbuda/Latin America & Caribbean,An integrated approach to physical adaptation and community resilience in Antigua and Barbuda’s northwest McKinnon’s watershed,"Antigua and Barbuda is a twin-island state located in the eastern region of the Caribbean Sea. This project will focus its efforts on a high risk and populated watershed on the northwest coast of Antigua. The project area is vulnerable to climate change, undergoing urban expansion, and supports low income and lower middle-income families. The project seeks to reduce vulnerability of the community, by increasing the ability of the watershed to handle extreme rainfall, while increasing the resilience of the built environment simultaneously to cope with the multiple stressors of climate change. This integrated approach will ensure that the community will be able to withstand projected climate change impacts while the ecosystems can accommodate increased rainfall. The three specific objectives of the project are to:  ",Multi-sector,Project Under Implementation,Department of Environment Ministry of Health and the Environment (ABED),Project Management Unit (PMU) of the ABED,3.5 years,3/17/2017,8/1/2017,,"USD 9,509,250","USD 9,970,000"
Argentina/Latin America & Caribbean,Enhancing the Adaptive Capacity and Increasing Resilience of Small-size Agriculture Producers of the Northeast of Argentina,"  In the northeast Argentina, 80% of the producers belong to small-scale family agriculture. Agricultural production is dominated by livestock production and crops. During recent years, the region has experienced a noticeable increase in the annual mean precipitation and changes in annual mean temperatures. In addition, the frequency of extreme precipitation has increased. Due to these changes, droughts and water deficit but also more frequent and intense floods are affecting the lives of small-scale agricultural producers. The main objective of the project is to increase the adaptive capacity and to build resilience of small-scale family agricultural producers in the face of climate change and climate variability impacts, particularly those deriving from the increase in the intensity of hydro-meteorological events, such as floods and droughts. The specific objectives of the project are:    ",Agriculture,Project Completed,Unidad Para Cambio Rural Argentina,"Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fishery;",4.5 years,4/4/2013,10/24/2013,12/31/2018,"USD 5,640,000","USD 5,640,000"
Argentina/Latin America & Caribbean,Increasing Climate Resilience and Enhancing Sustainable Land Management in the Southwest of the Buenos Aires Province,"The southwest of the Buenos Aires Province is a cattle rearing zone. The soils in Argentina’s semi-arid Pampa regions are especially vulnerable to increasing climate variability and change. Over the last century, Argentina has experienced significant agricultural intensification without much attention being given to environmental sustainability and the conservation of agroecosystems, natural resilience and adaptive capacity of the agricultural systems, which have therefore suffered significant damage and loss of their natural climate resilience. The project objective is to contribute to reduce climate and human induced vulnerability of the agroecosystems in the Southwest of the Buenos Aires Province by increasing adaptive capacity of key local institutions and actors, and piloting climate resilient and sustainable land management practices. Participatory planning processes will be used to identify and pilot concrete adaptation measures focusing on water, crops and livestock management to promote climate resilience.

Armenia/Eastern Europe,Strengthening land based adaptation capacity in communities adjacent to protected areas in Armenia,"Due to its climate and pronounced location in the South Caucasus with a mountainous landscape, fragile ecosystems and a vulnerable, agricultural based economy, the compounding effects of climate change and land degradation particularly affect livelihoods and economies of Armenia and its approximately 3 million inhabitants. In fact, climate trends over the previous 90 years have already indicated a significant warming trend. The summer season has become dryer and the number of extreme events, like hailstorms, has increased. Different climate change scenarios predict that this trend will continue to increase and substantially affect the marginal production areas. Crop and livestock production have already decreased in some areas, and if no additional climate adaptation measures were taken, will continue to decrease. Notably areas and communities adjacent to protected areas and forests – like Khosrov Forest State Reserve and Dilijan National Park – are vulnerable due to a persistent pressure on the remaining land and pasture resources, weak rural infrastructure and the lack of alternative income opportunities. The existing capacity to adapt to a changing climate and its increasing impacts on the rural livelihoods and their production systems is low, calling for concerted efforts to addresses the compounding challenges of land degradation and climate change impacts on rural livelihoods. The objective of the project is to reduce the climate risk vulnerability of local communities living adjacent to the “Khosrov Forest” and “Dilijan” National Park by strengthening the adaptive capacity of the agricultural sector and reinforcing their institutional and planning capacity for climate change adaptation.

Armenia/Eastern Europe,Artik city closed stonepit wastes and flood management pilot project,"For years exploited stone pits have had negative impact on the environment. Previously, more than 60% of the total volume of construction stone products of the Republic was produced in Artik and its adjacent communities. Many mines were closed due to reduction of construction stone consumption volumes, conservation and reclamation works of the mines have not been carried out thus causing many environmental problems. Hundreds of hectares of agricultural and natural landscapes were degraded and lost natural way of restoration due to such exploitation of mines. Dust through strong winds and solid remnants through snowmelt and rainfall spread over great distances polluting natural agro landscapes. The project seeks to improve resilience of highly exposed Artik city of Armenia to hydro-meteorological threats that are increasing in frequency and intensity as a result of climate change. The project will reduce the quantity of debris flowing to reservoir located down the Artik city and the pollution of agricultural lands (300 hectares of arable land 190 hectares of pastures, 15 hectares of hay meadows, 640 ha of artificial forests, 80ha of water reservoir and other natural landscapes) in the project impact area by increasing their resilience and adaptation to climate change.

Bangladesh/Asia-Pacific,Adaptation Initiative for Climate Vulnerable Offshore Small Islands and Riverine Charland in Bangladesh,"Bangladesh has a low-lying topography extremely exposed to sea level rise, cyclones, tidal surges, salinity intrusion, erratic rainfall, drought and floods, causing it to be one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change. The vulnerable communities who live on chars — small alluvial islands in rivers and the Bay of Bengal are particularly at risk from climate change. These communities have already experienced several climate change impacts including frequent tidal surges, increasingly intense cyclones and salt water intrusion into fresh water and soil. Furthermore, climate change is projected to have an adverse impact on agriculture and other local livelihoods; fragile houses, access to drinking water and rural infrastructure, which includes existing cyclone protection embankments. The impacts of climate change also disproportionately affect the poor and are especially severe for women and children, who are forced to spend a greater portion of their time on livelihood and domestic activities. The main objective of the project is to enhance the climate resilience of vulnerable communities who live on coastal islands and riverine chars in Bangladesh.

Belize/Latin America & Caribbean,Belize Marine Conservation and Climate Adaptation Initiative,"The coastal zones of Belize are critical to its economy, as the livelihoods of fishers, other resource extactors, and the tourism sector, relies upon these ecosystems. It will also be a zone affected by climate-induced increased storm surges. This project’s objective is to implement priority ecosystem-based marine conservation and climate adaptation measures to strengthen the climate resilience of the Belize Barrier Reef System. The project will take a two-pronged approach – both enhancing ecosystem function and therefore resilience through recovery and restoration, and reducing degradation caused by overexploitation and pollution. Specifically, the project will support (i) the improvement of the reef’s protection regime including an expansion and enforcement of the Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and replenishment (no-take) zones in strategically selected locations to climate resilience, (ii) promotion of sustainable alternative livelihoods for affected users of the reef, and (iii) building local capacity and raising awareness regarding the overall health of the reef ecosystem and the climate resilience of coral reefs.

Cambodia/Asia-Pacific,Climate Change Adaptation through Protective Small-scale Infrastructure Interventions in Coastal Settlements of Cambodia," Cambodia is vulnerable to droughts, floods and sea-level rise. The coastal area is also increasingly affected by strong winds, which are often associated with the onset of thunderstorms. Increases in sea levels are especially alarming for Cambodia’s coastal areas that are already experiencing severe seawater intrusion, beach erosion, high tides, and frequent storm surges. Additional impacts such as land subsidence in the region may even further intensify its effects. In addition, substantial saltwater incursion and coastal erosion has been observed throughout the coastal area, including in all eight of the target communes. Considering the topography of the area; primarily flat coastal plain, characterised by rice paddy and poor settlements, erosion and seawater incursion is having a substantial impact on the ability of people to source their livelihoods. The main objective of the project is to enhance climate change adaptation and resilience of the most vulnerable coastal human settlements of Cambodia through concrete climate change adaptation actions, particularly in areas where ecotourism has the potential to sustain such interventions. To achieve this objective, the project focuses its actions on highly vulnerable settlements in Kep Province and Prey Nob District of Preah Sihanouk Province. The anticipated impact of the project will be reflected in the Kep Province, where the project will target four sangkats/communes, with a total of 28,021 direct beneficiaries of the project’s interventions, and in Prey Nob District (in Preah Sihanouk Province) targeting seven communes, with a total of 34,500 beneficiaries.

Congo/Africa,Building adaptive capacity to climate change in vulnerable communities living in the Congo River Basin,"Congo is experiencing main climate change impacts such as extreme weather events, sea-level rise, average global temperature rise, and unpredictable rainfall patterns have considerable effects on people’s livelihoods. Consequently, changing climatic conditions threaten the achievement of development goals, with extreme consequences for the most vulnerable social groups. Large parts of the economy in Congo are highly climate sensitive in particular the agriculture, infrastructure and water sectors. Also, livelihoods are highly dependent on climate-sensitive natural resources such as dry land agriculture, forestry and local water resources. There is little protection against disasters from storms and floods and there is limited adaptive capacity. The project aims to reduce vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and strengthen adaptive capacities of vulnerable communities and the ecosystems they depend on, by promoting food security, nutrition and use a gender sensitive approach. The project purposely targets those who are most affected by climate change, poverty, food insecurity, and who rely on agricultural livelihoods that are limited by and vulnerable to climate change impacts, especially women and indigenous groups.

Costa Rica/Latin America & Caribbean,"Reducing the Vulnerability by Focusing on Critical Sectors (Agriculture, Water Resources and Coastlines) in order to Reduce the Negative Impacts of Climate Change and Improve the Resilience of these Sectors.","Costa Rica is experiencing the effects of increasing temperatures and intensity of extreme rainfall. These effects, due to climate change, are increasing the vulnerability of the water resources of the country, threatening the sustainable production of agricultural resources that promote food security and livelihoods, as well as negatively affecting mangroves and coral reefs, which serve as protective barriers to coastal communities. Objectives: The objective of this programme is to reduce climate vulnerability by focusing on critical sectors (agriculture, water resources, and coastal zones) in order to reduce the negative impacts of climate change, and improve the resilience of those populations. This program will seek to increase climate resilience by working directly with local stakeholders and anticipated beneficiaries through the implementation of adaptation projects in each of the geographical areas selected. Projects submitted by local organizations have been screened and the preselected proposals went through an in-depth assessment of their potential for the enhancement of climate resilience, which involves an analysis of the actions’ appropriateness, based on the local biophysical and socioeconomic context.

Djibouti/Africa,Integrated Water and Soil Resources Management Project (Projet de gestion intégrée des ressources en eau et des sols PROGIRES)," The Project will operate in the Adwaac, Deydey-Weyn, Medeho catchment areas and to a lesser extent in the Petit Bara/Ambouli and Grand Bara basins (six basins), belonging respectively to the regions of Tadjourah, Ali-Sabieh, Obock, Arta and Dikhil. These areas are characterized by high poverty rates with sites where natural resources are often degraded: the majority of the selected localities are located in these pockets of poverty. The choice of intervention sites has been based on four pre-established criteria agreed with the government, namely: (i) existence of untapped surface water resources (actual or potential), in sufficient quantity and quality; (ii) poverty index; (iii) population density or settlement dynamics; (iv) existence of agricultural potential and/or rangelands; plus (v) food security needs. For all the localities, the project will capitalize on what has already been done in other interventions by mobilizing and maximizing the potential of water resources through sound management and development of the resource in the context of climate change. The project will thus strengthen the capacities of households, men/women and young people to cope with climate change through practical training (field schools and demonstrations) and local support in various areas of individual or collective management: technical advice, professional advice and organization, advice on the management of the water mobilized and rangelands, environmental education, nutritional education and food security, access to social services andIncome-Generating Activities (IGAs),especially for young people and women, for income diversification. The main objective of PROGIRES is to improve the climate resilience of vulnerable ecosystems and increase the adaptive capacity of rural poor to respond to the impacts of climate change in Djibouti. Overall, the IGAs will target 800 IGA holders, i.e. 4,800 beneficiaries. It is expected that at the end of the project, the most marginalized women and youth will be able to create and sustainably manage economically profitable activities.  418,285  ",Water management,Project Under Implementation,International Fund Agricultural Dev,"Ministry of Agriculture, Water, Fisheries and Livestock",5.5 years,7/26/2021,3/29/2022,,"USD 1,052,450","USD 5,339,285"
Dominican Republic/Latin America & Caribbean,"Enhancing Climate Resilience in San Cristóbal province, Dominican Republic Integrated Water Resources Management and Rural Development Programme","Water is a transcendental aspect within the thematic priorities and cross-cutting themes of the development agenda of the Dominican Republic, due to its effects on public health and rural livelihoods. Integrated water resources management (IWRM), which considers climate change, especially in river basins, sub-basins and other sources of water supply for rural communities, is a requirement for any intervention related to water with which you want to address the impacts of climate change and the vulnerability of communities. The main objective of the program is to increase the resilience and capacity to adapt to climate impacts and risks on the water resources of rural communities in the Province of San Cristóbal and contribute to the diversification of their livelihoods. This objective will be achieved through improving the access to water supply and sanitation services, re-afforestation activities aligned with a correct land use, and increasing institutional and community capacity and coordination for integrated management that supports other uses of water, especially for the diversification of the livelihoods of communities.

Ecuador/Latin America & Caribbean,"Enhancing resilience of communities to the adverse effects of climate change on food security, in Pichincha Province and the Jubones River basin","Background:Nearly half of the communities in the Pichincha Province of Ecuador are affected by chronic malnutrition. Many small-scale farmers cannot feed their families adequately, as they have little or no access to capital, markets, or effective farming techniques and infrastructure. In the Olmedo community, for example, 90 percent of residents live below the poverty line and 40 percent are malnourished. At the same time, increasing population levels and the corresponding need for land have forced people to overexploit forests and to plant their crops on soil with high erosion rates. Poverty forces people to occupy unsafe areas most prone to natural disasters and increased population density is leaving more people exposed to reductions in water flows, decreased crop yields and ongoing environmental damage. Other factors contributing to vulnerability include lack of awareness of climate-related threats, the construction of homes on fragile land, and the inadequate quality of infrastructure and construction materials.

Ethiopia/Africa,Climate Smart Integrated Rural Development Project,"Agricultural production in Ethiopia is dominated by small-scale subsistence farmers (about 8 million households) who practice traditional farming methods, accounting for 95% of the total area under production. The high proportion of rain-fed crop production makes the sector very sensitive to rainfall variability. Productivity has historically been constrained by rainfall variability and extremes, low soil fertility and land/soil degradation. Erosion of topsoil and failure to return organic matter contributes further to soil deterioration. Ethiopia also has a large livestock population (the largest in Africa); livestock is a source of local income in the highlands (where mixed farming systems are often used) and in lowlands/pastoral farming systems, where livestock are a critical part of livelihoods and the principal capital of farmers. Over 80% of agricultural holders practice mixed systems. Critically, both agriculture and livestock sectors are heavily impacted by the frequent major droughts and floods. Drought is a critical climate related hazard in Ethiopia, frequently occurring in many parts of the country. A large part of Ethiopia  is dryland, where annual rainfall is low and seasonal and inter-annual variability is high. These areas are highly vulnerable; desertification and drought have been a persistent problem throughout history, with associated food shortages and famine. Floods are the other major climate related hazard in the country. Major floods – leading to loss of life and property – have occurred in different parts of the country although there are much more common smaller events. The overall objective of the project is to increase resilience to recurrent droughts in seven agro-ecological landscapes in Ethiopia. An integrated water, agriculture and natural resource management approach will be adopted to achieve the following outcomes:      ",Rural development,Project Under Implementation,Ministry of Finance and Economic Cooperation of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia,MoFEC,4 years,3/17/2017,7/20/2017,3/31/2022,"USD 9,987,910","USD 9,987,910"
Fiji/Asia-Pacific,Increasing the resilience of informal urban settlements in Fiji that are highly vulnerable to climate change and disaster risks,"Fiji is located in the Pacific Ocean’s tropical cyclone belt. The island nation experiences frequent cyclones (on average, one cyclone per year) and with them damaging winds, rain and storm surges. Besides cyclones, the country suffers from other extreme events associated with climate change such as extreme rainfall, flooding, droughts and temperature extremes as well as sea-level rise. Being mountainous in its interior, cities and towns are mainly located on the coast and along rivers. The result is that Fiji’s towns and cities are particularly exposed to seaborne and riverine natural hazards, cyclones, storm surges, coastal and riverine erosion, landslides, floods and already occurring sea level rise due to climate change. Mangrove deforestation and coral reef extraction in order to accommodate urban development and for reasons of income generation are increasing the vulnerability of urban areas to coastal hazards, as both mangrove forests and coral reefs provide effective barriers against storm surges and cyclones. Of particularly critical concern are the residents of informal settlements in towns and cities as many such settlements are located in highly vulnerable areas, such as riverbanks and pockets of coastal land. The project will focus on informal settlements across four urban areas and towns in Fiji: Lautoka, Sigatoka, Nadi and Lami, which are located in the Greater Suva Urban Area. The overall objective of the project is to increase the resilience of informal urban settlements in Fiji that are highly vulnerable to climate change and disaster risks.

Georgia/Eastern Europe,Dairy Modernization and Market Access: Adaptation Component (DiMMAdapt),"   The Programme will cover 36 percent of all rural settlements and more than half of a country’s total rural population. While the three contiguous regions of Imereti, Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti and Samtskhe-Javakhetise regions, where the programme will start to be implemented, are not the poorest in country, poverty levels are still high, especially in remote and mountainous communities where climate vulnerability is an issue. The identified regions have relatively large climate vulnerable mountainous areas where the households are identified as being dependent on degraded pastures. The 3 regions covered by the project are already, and will be even more severely subject to, climate change risks in the form of frequent seasonal and yearly droughts, heat waves, rainfall storms and associated land degradation. As pressures from overgrazing are considerable factors in pasture degradation, the project areas will comprise 50% of the national cattle population and where almost 99 percent of cattle owners are smallholders with less than 20 heads of cattle. The project will target: i) smallholder livestock farmers with 1-20 herd of cattle, and will be the focus of most training and technical assistance activities for smallholder farmers +PUAs; and ii) smallholder farmers that will not comply to EU regulation on dairy products and are willing to diversify their activities. The anticipated total number of the DiMMA direct beneficiaries will be at least 6,000 smallholder farmers (approximately 16,500 people in 5,000 households). The overall goal of the project is to reduce the vulnerability of the dairy value chain to the deleterious impacts of climate change by enhancing the resilience of vulnerable dairy producers.

Ghana/Africa,Increased Resilience to Climate Change in Northern Ghana through the Management of Water Resources and Diversification of Livelihoods,"  The programme targets the three regions in the northern part of Ghana: the Upper East, Upper West and Northern Regions. Compared to other regions of the country, these three northern regions have high degree of exposure to climate variability and change characterized by increasing temperatures and decreasing and erratic rainfall. These factors make the northern regions highly vulnerable to climate change and high priority regions for climate change adaptation. The main objective of the programme is to enhance the resilience and adaptive capacity of rural livelihoods to climate impacts and risks on water resources in the northern region of Ghana. The objective will be achieved through key results centered on the improvement of water access and also increase institutional capacity and coordination for integrated water management to support other uses of water resources especially for the diversification of livelihoods by rural communities.

India/Asia-Pacific,"Building Adaptive Capacities of Communities, Livelihoods and Ecological Security in the Kanha-Pench Corridor of Madhya Pradesh","The Kanha-Pench Corridor (KPC) spreads across three administrative districts (Balaghat, Mandla and Seoni) of the Central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. In the last two decades, the Kanha-Pench Corridor has faced severe degradation caused by an increase in anthropogenic pressure and climate change. Studies of the corridor area reveal that while the forests within the corridor has excellent patches with continuous regeneration, patches which are completely or partially degraded are increasing constantly due to their diversion for developmental purposes or by over extraction of its resources (fuel wood, timber, fodder etc). This situation in the landscape is further exacerbated by climate change. The rainfall and temperature patterns in the region have undergone a change in the past few decades which have impacted both forests and other ecosystem based livelihoods like agriculture and livestock. The KPC forms one of the most crucial tiger conservation units of the world, as it is still a contiguous forest patch of 16,000 km2 and connects the Kanha and Pench Tiger reserves. The KPC also supports rich biodiversity and provides important ecosystem services like regulating hydrology and carbon sequestration. Besides its ecological functions, the KPC supports a substantial human population that is extremely vulnerable socio-economically. The project will be implemented in 56 villages that lie in and around the KPC which is one of the 4 forested wildlife movement corridors in the Satpuda Maikal Landscape.

India/Asia-Pacific,Climate Proofing of Watershed Development Projects in the States of Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan,"Rajasthan is characterized by erratic and low rainfall with varying intensity and uneven distribution of heavy intensity rainfall in short spell. In addition, the steep slopes with sandy soils make livelihoods of small and marginal farmers from natural resources a very challenging task. A major portion of rainfall goes off as runoff, which also takes the top layer of soil away from the fields.  The water tables in general are very deep and are declining further on account of overdraft. Combination of all these factors makes agriculture a very difficult proposition in the region. Hence, the central focus of this project is on works related to water and soil conservation and watershed development. Tamil Nadu, a southern state of India, is one of the water starved states, where the per capita availability of water resources is 900 cubic meters per year as compared to all India average of 2,200 cubic meters.  The annual average rainfall for the state is around 921.50 mm (48% during north-east monsoon, 35% during south-west monsoon, 14% during summer and 3% during winter). In the absence of perennial rivers, rainfall is the only source of water in the state and that too inconsistent due to vagaries of monsoon. There is an urgent need for replenishing the ground water aquifer with each and every drop of rain water to ward-off impending severe water scarcity and for sustainable development. Rain water harvesting and run-off management structures such as check dams, percolation ponds, farm ponds, Water Absorption Trenches (WATs), recharge shafts etc. are required to be constructed in order to improve the moisture regime of the watershed for increased land use). Objectives: The overall objective of this program is to improve climate resilience and build adaptive capacities of the communities to climate change in the rain-fed areas of Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan. Objective 1: Improving adaptation to climate variability / change in farm sector with better management and maintenance of soil and water regime enabling better crop / pasture land productivity and resultant increase in income of small and marginal farmers.Objective 2: Promoting climate resilient farming system and diversification of livelihoods engaging community and their associations in the concrete adaptation pathway.Objective 3: Reducing climate change vulnerability and process of marginalization with integration of risk mitigation products, like crop, weather and market advisory; and information system.Objective 4: Creation of knowledge management system on climate change adaptation and sharing the learning to wider audience for replication and technology cascading.

India/Asia-Pacific,Enhancing Adaptive Capacity and Increasing Resilience of Small and Marginal Farmers in Purulia and Bankura Districts of West Bengal,"In West Bengal, an eastern state of India, 17.4% of the total Net State Domestic Product (NSDP, 2012-13) and 70% of the total population, mainly the rural population, are dependent on climate sensitive sectors (such as agriculture including animal husbandry and horticulture, forestry and fisheries). This project aims at developing climate adaptive and resilient livelihood systems through diversification, technology adoption and natural resource management for rural small and marginal farmers associated with agriculture and allied sector in Lateritic Zone of West Bengal. Specifically, it would seek to enhance adaptive capacity of vulnerable farm families in semi-arid regions of Purulia and Bankura districts of West Bengal by introducing measures to tide over the adverse impacts of climate change on their food and livelihood security.

India/Asia-Pacific,Conservation and Management of Coastal Resources as a Potential Adaptation Strategy for Sea Level Rise,"The Krishna delta, home to about 4.5 million people, is located in the state of Andhra Pradesh on the southeast coast of India. The project region is highly vulnerable to the predicted changes in the climatic condition and sea level rise and associated extreme events such as cyclones and floods. The cumulative effect of sea level rise and increased intensity of cyclonic storms has lead to salinization of land and water resources. According to an estimate, a total area of 35,000 ha of prime agriculture land in coastal Andhra Pradesh will become saline due to sea level rise alone which will lead to lesser productivity of land resources and, in turn, reduce income and increase poverty in vulnerable coastal areas. Objectives: The aim of the project is to overcome the consequences of salinization and other impacts of the coastal area due to sea level rise and seawater inundation due to increased cyclonic storms and storm surges through appropriate adaptation strategies such as restoration of degraded mangroves and demonstration of Integrated Mangrove Fishery Farming System (IMFFS). Restoration of mangroves will be taken up in degraded, saline and unprotected mangrove areas located in Revenue Department land and thus, it will serve as a model for management of similar areas of unprotected mangroves. Restoration of degraded mangroves will be undertaken with native multiple mangrove species to improve the health of the mangrove forest, which in turn, will avoid ingression of seawater. It is proven that an increase in the height of the mangrove substratum is almost equal to predicted annual increase in sea level. The mangrove ecosystem will help to build the land through sedimentation of suspended solids in the root zone preventing exposure of land, water, other coastal resources and livelihood assets to saline water inundation. IMFFS will be demonstrated in lands owned by small aqua farms so that it can be a model for other farmers both to sustain income from fish farming as well as improve protection from cyclonic storms. IMFFS will also increase the opportunity to integrate both physical security against sea level rise and livelihood security of the coastal community. The raised bunds of this farming system are planned to act as embankments protecting coastal villages from salt water intrusion during storm surges.The executing entity of the project is M. S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF), supported by Praja Pragathi Seva Sangam (PPSS). MSSRF has worked in the region for several years and restored more than 450 ha of degraded mangroves.

Indonesia/Asia-Pacific,"Safekeeping-Surviving-Sustaining towards Resilience: 3S Approach to Build Coastal City Resilience to Climate Change Impacts and Natural Disasters in Pekalongan City, Central Java Province","Adaptation measures taken in Pekalongan City to address climate change issue are somewhat lacking in evaluation that derives from the non-existent of a comprehensive climate risk assessment. A such complex issue such as climate change needs across-the-board measures to be able to address the issue effectively, and from its roots. Considering that most of the risks are deriving from changes in climate indicators, hence it is of importance to develop climate risk assessment prior to intervening with different projects, so that the projects results can be tracked back to the initial level of risk. It is this gap that this proposed programme tries to bridge, by implementing comprehensive approach encompassing technical assessment, planning, intervention, and also monitoring and evaluation; which will be supported by framework and measures to fortify institutional mechanism on climate adaptation and resilience issue. In practical the programme components will be started with identifying the roots of the problem (climate risk assessment) and followed by developing and implementing the adaptation plan (in the form of intervention projects) which results can be tracked back to the problem; while simultaneously building stakeholders’ capacity and advocating climate resilience policy along the course of the programme. This programme will focus on building resilience to climate change impacts in Pekalongan City, one of the coastal cities in Central Java Province (in North Coast of Java region), by employing interventions in the form of not only hard structure but also soft structure; touching not only physical interventions but also building their socio-economic and institutional capacity.

Indonesia/Asia-Pacific,Community Adaptation for Forest-Food Based Management in Saddang Watershed Ecosystem," The level of area risk due to climate change associated with the disaster level in the Saddang Watershed area shows that 93% of villages in the watershed are vulnerable to climate change. Increased rainfall caused various disasters in watershed area, which is recorded as many as 342 times starting from 2009-2014 in form of landslides and floods. These disasters resulted in about 66% of decrease in food productivity of the commodities of rice crops. The productivity of agricultural and plantation products also decreased due to the decreasing of land carrying capacity and high level of critical land in the area of Saddang Watershed. Temperature increases in future projections will aggravate environmental conditions due to climate change such as causing the extinction of some species of wildlife and plants, increasing the frequency of floods and droughts, and decreasing food productivity in both local and regional scales. In line with the main objectives of Indonesia’s 2014 Climate Change Adaptation National Action Plan (RAN – API), through a series of interventions from this project will be able to increase resilience to climate change impacts both in food security through the development of forest food and food diversification, as well as ecosystem resilience through enhancement of forest cover quality in the Priority Watershed, as well as resilience through integrated coastal management.

Lao People's Democratic Republic/Asia-Pacific,Building climate and disaster resilience capacities of vulnerable small towns in Lao PDR," Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR) has been increasingly affected by extreme weather events. This is particularly problematic due to its high sensitivity, resulting from dependence on climate-sensitive natural resources and its low adaptive capacity. The impacts of extreme weather events have been severe to the point that in 2013 Lao PDR was named the 7th most severely affected country in the world by climate change. Irregularity in rainfall has led to both floods and droughts, with a variation in severity from year to year. Projected increases in flooding and droughts are expected to impact livelihoods, health, physical infrastructure and the economy in general. In addition to extreme events, variation in the seasons has disrupted cropping, causing food insecurity. The objective of this project is to build climate resilience in small towns along the east-west economic corridor in the central region of Lao PDR. This will be achieved through the provision of climate resilient water infrastructure and the mainstreaming of climate change into urban planning. The project has three components.

Madagascar/Africa,Promoting climate resilience in the rice sector through pilot investments in Alaotra-Mangoro region,"Rice production in Madagascar occurs in a variety of areas, from the rainfed central highlands, to the irrigated and terraced lowlands, and semi flooded coastal zones. Roughly 10 million people in Madagascar, or almost 70% of its population, derive at least part of their economic income from rice. In the central highlands, where most of the country’s rice is grown, rice crops are already vulnerable to land degradation and droughts. Rice grown in the lowlands is subject flash floods and extreme temperatures. Other climate challenges include variability in the onset of rains, delays in rainy seasons, as well as disruptions in the amount of rainfall during the rice-growing season. This project implemented by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) aims to help those in the rice sector increase climate resilience through increased rice production that will withstand projected climate conditions and increased environmental sustainability and ecological services in the rice sector by working with local producers and partners, with the support of decentralized ministries and regional technical partners and supporting the selection of a limited number of optimal integrated rice cultivation models, or systems. The project will also provide the tools for crop modeling and vulnerability analysis, particularly focusing on the rice sector, as well as the development of a climate-based hydrological model for the region, in order to gain a sound grasp of future water availability. As a means of providing stronger technical support to local producers, the project will also provide enhanced agro-climatic services, including updated crop and cultivation calendars that take new climate trends into account. The project will extend climate and weather information to local producers to provide early warning of flooding and drought. Farmers will receive the appropriate working material, starting with adapted seeds and varieties, appropriate fertilizers and adequate quantities and quality of water. They will learn new land and agrobiodiversity management practices involved in rice production, including sustainability land mangement and agroforestry practices designed to assist communities in coping with climate shocks such as droughts and floods, and to reduce post harvest losses. The project will help bring together government, private sector, NGOs, as well as academic and research institutions and local representatives to examine current policies and make recommendations on the modification of policies, rules and norms related to rice with a view to increasing adaptive capacity in the sector. The project also plans to support replication and upscaling of successful adaptation approaches, and to generate broader scientific knowledge on rice adaptation.

Today, environmental heritage, the major wealth of the productive activities in the Moroccan oases, which has already been weakened by recurrent periods of drought, and is subject to an arid climate and irrational modes of exploitation (overfishing, overgrazing, excessive water pumping, etc.), is now further degraded. As a result of the degrading ecosystem, the oases no longer provide sufficient means of subsistence thus the oasis populations are forced to resort to seasonal migration and have an increased dependence on the income earned from migrating. This results in the abandonment of practices adapted for the oasis zone, and leading to a loss of environmental services. The oases are currently facing the additional challenge of climate change, which may bring with it even greater constraints (water scarcity, extreme weather events).

Myanmar/Asia-Pacific,Addressing Climate Change Risks on Water Resources and Food Security in the Dry Zone of Myanmar,"This project, “Addressing Climate Change Risks in Water Resources and Food Security in the Dry Zone of Myanmar”, seeks to minimize the increasing impacts of climate change on agricultural and livestock production cycles in the Myanmar Dry Zone. From increasing temperature and water evaporation, to declining water availability, more frequent droughts, and intensifying weather events especially flash floods and cyclones, the local economies of this region are expected to be impacted by climate change. Analysis of drought occurrence over the past few decades has confirmed that the Dry Zone has turned into the most food insecure region in the country. The adaptation activities of this UNDP project will be implemented in five townships in the Sagaing, Mandalay and Magway Regions –Shwebo and Moneywa townships in the Sagaing region, Myingyan and Nyaung Oo townships in the Mandalay Region, and Chauk township in the Magway Region. Myanmar’s Dry Zone is one of the most climate sensitive and natural resource poor regions in Myanmar. The Dry Zone lies between latitudes 19° 20″ and 22° 50″ north and longitudes 93° 40″ and 96° 30″ east, stretching across the southern part of Sagaing Division, the western and middle part of Mandalay Division and most parts of Magway Division. It’s situated in the rain shadow area of the Yakhaing Yoma and obtains most of its rainfall from the southwest monsoon. The Dry Zone covers approximately 54,390 km2 and represents about 10% of the country’s total land area. It’s the third most densely populated region in Myanmar, at 123 people per km2. Across the Dry Zone, water is scarce, vegetation cover is thin, and soil is severely eroded.

Namibia/Africa,Pilot rural desalination plants using renewable power and membrane technology," Namibia relies heavily on groundwater for the supply of water, and the predicted increase in both temperature and rainfall variability due to climate change will increase this reliance. However, in many areas the dissolved solids content of the locally available groundwater exceeds the approved threshold for human consumption. Decreased aquifer recharge due to periods of lower rainfall caused by climate change is likely to cause an increase in total dissolved solids in groundwater, which will exacerbate the water quality situation. Pumping water over long distances from other water sources is not a feasible option for supplying small communities with good quality water. An alternative is to improve the quality of locally abstracted groundwater by applying treatment techniques. These techniques require energy in the form of electricity, but many of the small communities are not coupled to the national electricity grid. It is also considered that the energy needs for treatment should be met by sustainable and environmentally sound resources. The objective of the project is to pilot the treatment by reverse osmosis (RO) of poor quality local groundwater to a level that complies with the national standards for drinking water, using sun and wind energy to power the process. Execution of the project will yield a wide range of information and knowledge on both technical and social aspects of establishing and operating such treatment and power plants. The acquired information, knowledge and skills will then be communicated to stakeholders in the water supply sector in order that the applied technology could be mainstreamed and replicated elsewhere in the country. The project will result in improved resilience of vulnerable communities and groups to climate change impact, specifically to a decrease in chemical water quality of existing groundwater sources. In addition to providing benefits to vulnerable communities in the target areas, the project will also serve to increase the capacity of government agencies to integrate climate change adaptation considerations into water supply planning and policy processes.

Panama/Latin America & Caribbean,Adapting to climate change through integrated water management in Panama,"Panama is considered a highly vulnerable country to climate change impacts. Panama experiences a series of extreme weather events including intense and protracted rainfalls, windstorms, floods, droughts, wildfires, earthquakes, landslides, tropical cyclones, tsunamis and ENSO/El Niño-La Niña events. Panama is considered one of the countries with the largest water resources, approximately 35,000 m3 of renewable freshwater resources per capita. This relative abundance scenario hides a series of regional and seasonal limitations, specifically those associated to the most arid region of the country known as the “Arco Seco”. This relative water abundance scenario and increasing conflicts are aggravated by climate variability and extreme weather events, mainly droughts and floods, where users and authorities have a lack of means and information to face them timely and effectively. This project situates water management at the center of the adaptation efforts, promoting climate resilience and vulnerability reduction through enhancing food and energy security, based on an integrated water resources management approach that highlights the water-energy-food-climate change adaptation nexus. To do this, the project will focus efforts in two river watersheds, Chiriquí Viejo and Santa María, both prioritized in light of its water resources, its importance for energy and food production at a national scale, and the existence of unsolved conflicts among water users.

Paraguay/Latin America & Caribbean,Ecosystem Based Approaches for Reducing the Vulnerability of Food Security to the Impacts of Climate Change in the Chaco region of Paraguay,"The Republic of Paraguay is a landlocked country in central South America, bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the east and northeast and Bolivia to the northwest. The country is divided by the Paraguay River into two regions. To the east of the river is the Eastern Region, with 14 departments and the capital district. To the west of the river is the Western Region or Chaco, which represents more than 60% of the country’s land area and has 3 departments: Presidente Hayes, Alto Paraguay and Boqueron. According to the Permanent Household Survey 2013, the Paraguayan population considered to be in poverty represents 23.8% of the country’s total population, which means that about 1.6 million people live in households whose income is lower than the cost of a basic basket of consumption estimated for that year.

Peru/Latin America & Caribbean,"AYNINACUY: Strengthening the livelihoods of vulnerable highland communities in the provinces of Arequipa, Caylloma, Condesuyos, Castilla and La Union in the Region of Arequipa, Peru","In Peru raising Andean camelids is the main livelihood among the highland communities, whose population engaged in this activity, is estimated to be approximately 1.5 million. Camelid producing areas in Peru include the provinces with the highest levels of poverty and marginalization. Due to the impacts of climate change, the activity of raising camelids by vulnerable Andean highlands communities in Peru has been being severely affected, with cyclical annual losses in thousands of heads of camelids, which threatens the sustainability of these communities’ principal livelihood. Within the Peruvian territory the effects of climate change also differ, by region and socioeconomic levels, and, in the distribution of negative climate impacts, the rural poor of highland mountain ecosystems will bear the brunt of these changes. In these areas, glacier retreat has reduced the availability of water and has led to the desertification and soil degradation.  While drought, cold spells, and frost are phenomena that have always been present in many regions, like the case of Arequipa, Peru, the effects of climate variability have resulted in these phenomena recently being more frequent and intense at these altitudes. Consequently, this intensification is causing severe damage to this region’s fragile environment, affecting one of its most vulnerable population groups, located in the high Andean mountains. In particular, this has an impact on the health and survival of camelid herds, in the main, alpacas, which are essential for their subsistence. The project objective is to reduce vulnerability and increase adaptive capacity to respond to the impacts of climate change of the highland Andean peasant communities in the provinces of Arequipa, Caylloma, Castilla, La Union, and Condesuyos.

Peru/Latin America & Caribbean,Adaptation to the Impacts of Climate Change on Peru’s Coastal Marine Ecosystem and Fisheries,"Peru sustains the most productive fisheries in the world, yielding nearly 10% of world’s fish catch. The main driving factor for this enormous productivity is the physical and chemical characteristics of its coastal upwelling, which allow the efficient growth of primary producers, high survival rates of larvae and the efficient trophic transfer to foraging fish and top predators. The scope of this proposal encompasses these two coastal marine ecosystems: the Peruvian Coastal Upwelling Ecosystem (PCUE) and the Tropical Eastern Pacific Coastal Ecosystem. The two targeted ecosystems are subject of significant climatic variability that range from the interannual scale (El Niño Southern Oscillation, ENSO) to the scale of decades or centuries, as palaeoclimatic research has revealed. For example, during strong El Niño events, the warm and nutrient-poor water masses extend along the coast and the overall coastal productivity decrease. Due to thermal stress and scarcity of food sources, anchovy populations become highly vulnerable and experience high natural mortality. Meanwhile, warm-water, tropical fish species migrate along the coast. The opposite responses occur during the cool La Niña events. Therefore the climatic ecological impacts can have dramatic socio-economic consequences for the fishing industry and for the artisanal fishing communities. The main challenge consists in increasing the resilience of the coastal marine ecosystems and the coastal communities (particularly the artisanal fishing communities) to climate change impacts. The main beneficiaries of this project are the artisanal fishing communities, whose livelihoods largely depends on the status of the coastal marine ecosystems, which are already subject to a number of non-climatic threats. The overall objective of the project is to reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities to impacts of climate change on the coastal marine ecosystems and fishery resources. This will require the implementation of a group of adaptation measures that include:       ",Coastal management,Project Under Implementation,Peruvian Trust Fund for National Parks and Protected Areas,Ministry of Production of Peru,4 years,3/18/2016,5/17/2018,,"USD 6,950,239","USD 6,950,239"
Regional/Other,"Scaling-up climate-resilient rice production in West Africa (Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Gambia (Republic of the), Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo)"," Rice is a staple crop that has been grown in West Africa for more than 3500 years, since the domestication of African rice (Oryza glaberrima). Produced by low-income smallholders across the entire region, rice plays a key role in regional food security for rural and urban populations. In recent years, increasing demand stemming from population growth and steady increases in annual per capita consumption has outpaced production, leading to ever-increasing rice imports from Asia, accounting for 46% of total rice consumption in 2017. As rice production is practiced across the entire region in all climate zones and is dominantly rainfed, key risks from the increasing variability of climate events will result in the disruption of the growing season calendars, shortening of the cropping season, and exacerbated dry spells, droughts, and heatwaves. It will also create greater likelihoods of floods, shortage of irrigation water, strong winds and storms, and changes in incidences and geographic range of pests and diseases – all of which can lead to substantial rice yield reductions or crop failure. By using the Climate-Resilient Rice Production (CRRP) approach proposed on this project, the Rice Offensive can address several critical challenges simultaneously: respond to increasing rice consumption needs, strengthen livelihoods of rice farming communities, allow for diversification of economic activities along the rice value chain, improve the overall national economic well-being, free up hard currency – previously used for rice imports – for other national needs, and contribute to political stability. Promoting adaptation to the  climate change threats. The RICOWAS project preparation has taken the SRI-WAAPP results into account and is designed to build on these achievements. The RICOWAS project will focus on scaling up CRRP as an adaptation measure to different and location-specific climate threats. It will also contribute directly to the objectives of the Rice Offensive as specified in the Regional Agricultural Policy for West Africa (ECOWAP) of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The global objective of the project is to improve climate resilience and increase rice system productivity of smallholder rice farmers across West Africa using a climate-resilient rice production approach.

Regional/Other,Increasing the resilience of both displaced persons and host communities to climate change-related water challenges in Jordan and Lebanon," The Mashreq region is part of the most water scarce region in the world and both urban and rural areas face water challenges. However, some urban areas, especially in Lebanon and Jordan, experience extreme pressure on water availability, both in quantity and quality, exacerbated by climate change, the unprecedented influx of Displaced Persons (DPs) especially from Syria, and groundwater over extraction and pollution challenges. The overall aim of this project is to better respond to climate change impacts and vulnerabilities in the context of the Syrian crisis in Jordan and Lebanon. This is done by demonstrating what concrete adaptation measures  respond to the needs of both DPs and host communities, and especially women and youth, while avoiding any tension over resources and employment opportunities. The project will focus on responding to climate change-related water challenges by taking a sustainable water management approach. This means it aims to reduce the demand of unsustainable water sources such as over-extracted (and often polluted) groundwater, while increasing water supply options from non- conventional and more sustainable sources, including, rainwater harvesting and the reuse of treated waste water.

ENANDES countries share the influence on their climate of the Andes, the most important mountain range in the Southern Hemisphere. The impressive length, continuity and height of the Andes create a wide variety of environmental conditions, including fragile mountainous ecosystems, arid, semiarid and forested areas. All three countries have long, low-lying coasts with important fishery resources. Moreover, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO), the major single source of interannual climate fluctuations in many parts of the world, strongly affects ENANDES countries. Despite considerable advances in climate science, potentially useful climate information often goes unused and thus stakeholders are not fully benefiting from effective climate information and services in support of decision-making, risk management and adaptation. To improve this situation, there is growing interest in enhancing the operational provision and uptake of climate services – defined as the timely provision of climate-related knowledge and information to support decisions in climate-sensitive sectors. The proposed project “Enhancing Adaptive Capacity of Andean Communities through Climate Services” – hereafter “ENANDES” – seeks to enhance the capacity of society and communities to adapt to a varying and changing climate by producing, communicating and assessing the use of credible, authoritative, and useful information as the scientific evidence for decision- and policy-making on preparedness for, and reduction of damages from climatic hazards in Chile, Colombia and Peru. Because increasing societal resilience to climate is not just about enhancing information, ENANDES will help build human and infrastructure capacity, and will seek to overcome institutional, technological and cultural barriers through increased coordination among climate and non-climate actors of society.

A large part of the housing demand is being met by growing informal settlements characterized by poor living conditions, lack of access to basic services and infrastructure, and often located in areas exposed to natural hazards. Southern Africa is highly exposed to recurrent natural hazards such as cyclones, floods, sea level rise/coastal erosion and drought. Urban areas are generally more vulnerable to risks than rural areas, due to denser populations, concentration of assets and variety of activities within comparatively smaller geographical areas. Urban risks are exacerbated by the increasing severity and unpredictability of disruptive events caused by climate change effects. At the same time, inadequate institutional capacities and weak governance processes are significantly exacerbated by the rapid expansion of both formal and informal urban settlements. Developing local governance capacity in risk management and resilience planning is a key strategy to reduce the multiple risks cities are exposed to and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. The project will strengthen urban climate resilience by working with various levels of government and stakeholders and ensuring strong participation, in particular, of the most marginalized and vulnerable groups, in all its phases – from conception to evaluation.

Rwanda/Africa,Reducing Vulnerability to Climate Change in North West Rwanda through Community Based Adaptation,"Rwanda’s high population density combined with its reliance on rain-fed agriculture means that the predominantly rural population is increasingly farming smaller and smaller plots of land. The large number of people farming on Rwanda’s hilly and mountainous terrain has led to serious environmental degradation due to overexploitation of the soil and extensive erosion. The farmed Northern and Western uplands of Rwanda are considered the most vulnerable to erosion due to their steeper terrain and higher annual rainfall. In addition to these unsustainable farming practices, there has been significant unplanned settlement in fragile and sensitive areas. Recent changes in the variability of rainfall have had a dramatic effect on these already highly perturbed ecosystems particularly in the mountainous North West part of the country which has experienced floods and landslides. Objectives: The objective of the project is to increase the adaptive capacity of natural systems and rural communities living in exposed areas of North Western Rwanda to climate change impacts. The strategy of the project is to manage the risks and effects from recurring floods, landslides and erosion through an integrated natural resource management and alternative livelihoods programme in one of the most climate sensitive and vulnerable areas of Rwanda. The project aims to address factors that exacerbate the effects of intense rainfall and lead to flooding and landslides. These include erosion and unsustainable farming practices linked to demographic pressure on natural resources. By introducing erosion and flood control measures, building the capacity of farmers to adapt to climate variability and supporting the development of off-farm livelihoods to reduce the pressure on natural resources, the project will restore the ecosystem functions necessary to reduce the incidence and severity of flooding and landslides on local communities and resources.

Senegal/Africa,Adaptation to Coastal Erosion in Vulnerable Areas,"Just a few years ago, the beach at Saly Portudal, in Senegal, was filled with tourists lounging under grass umbrellas, footballers playing pick-up games, and fishermen unloaded their catches, but today the coastal community in Senegal is one of countless coastal communities around the world that are suffering from sea-level rise and the other negative effects of accelerated climate change. After the beach was submerged, the largest tour operator in the Senegalese village departed and hotel room prices fell. As the number of tourists dwindled, so did the household incomes of Saly Portudal’s many local craftsmen. Erosion and salt-water flooding has destroyed rice fields, damaged docks and buildings, and caused silt buildups that hamper transit between rivers and the sea. The project, which encompasses the areas of Rufisque, Saly, and Joal, aims to protect people, houses, economic and cultural infrastructure in the region against coastal erosion. In Rufisque, work is being done on an update on the detailed technical feasibility studies for the design of coastal protection facilities and the achievements of those tasks; the validation of the feasibility studies; achievement of the infrastructure of protection; and the cleaning up of canals and connection with the sea. In Saly, the project is setting up protection facilities in the vulnerable areas where hotels, people and poor villages, as well as fishing docks are located. In Joal, the focus is on protecting against salination in the rice-growing areas, coastal infrastructure for processing activities, conducting Environmental Impact Assessment studies, and the monitoring of the implemented Environmental and Social Management plan. Other goals for Joal include an anti-salt barrier, strengthening of protection and development of the beach and fish smoke kilns, as well as the strengthening of environmental assessment awareness and training. Across all three project sites, the aim is to develop regulations that encompass adaptation, the revision of the environmental code, the adoption of the law on the littoral, and helping local people better understand adaptation techniques to climate change in coastal areas and about the importance of respecting regulations for the management of littoral zones.

Solomon Islands/Asia-Pacific,Enhancing urban resilience to climate change impacts and natural disasters: Honiara,"Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Pacific, such as the Solomon Islands, are amongst the most vulnerable countries to the risks of future climate change. In Honiara – the capital city of the Solomon Islands – there is acute sensitivity to external shocks and stresses due to existing ‘adaptation deficits’ in urban infrastructure, housing and service provision. These deficits result from a range of development drivers; including rapid and unplanned urbanization, the associated growth of informal settlements, a lack of adequate infrastructure and basic services in many areas, issues related to land tenure in peri-urban areas, and weak institutional structures governing the urban environment. The intention of this project is therefore to work with vulnerable urban communities in Honiara to implement climate adaptation actions and to undertake capacity strengthening initiatives across multiple urban scales – community, ward and city-wide (including issues that cross the city-province boundary) – in order to strengthen the climate resilience of the city. The overarching goal of this project is to enhance the resilience of Honiara and its inhabitants to current and future climate impacts and natural disasters, with a particular focus on pro-poor adaptation actions that involve and benefit the most vulnerable communities.

South Africa/Africa,Taking adaptation to the ground: A small Grants Facility for enabling local-level responses to climate change,"Climate change projections have indicated that both the Mopani District, in Limpopo in the north east of South Africa, and the Namakwa District, in the Northern Cape in the north west of South Africa, will be subject to increasing temperatures and changing rainfall patterns. According to local scale analysis of historical trends and future projections, there is a distinct warming trend for both Mopani and Namakwa, which will be far more severe by 2050 if global mitigation efforts are unsuccessful. Rainfall changes are much less certain, with temporal and spatial variability. Yet in historical trends there are indications of an increase in the intensity of heavy rainfall events in both areas, evident through a decrease in the number of rain days coupled with an unchanged average annual rainfall. Warming, and the associated increase in the number of extremely warm days, is set to impact evaporation rates and water availability. This is a concern as water is already scarce in Namakwa and in parts of Mopani. Greater amplitude of dry and wet spells, along with increasing temperatures, will negatively impact already stressed communities in both areas – thus rendering them more vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability and change, more specifically droughts, seasonal shifts and storm-related disaster events. Climate-related risks are generally greater for disadvantaged, rural and poor communities because of limited adaptive capacity and greater sensitivity to climate-driven impacts. Both Mopani and Namakwa Districts are characterized by the prevalence of rural, poor communities vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability and change. This threat requires climate finance for adaptation activities to find its way to these most vulnerable communities. However, such communities typically lack the capacity required to access the necessary funding. The project thus entails the implementation of a small grant finance mechanism to address this financial, capacity and adaptation need. The Community Adaptation Small Grants Facility (SGF) will increase climate resilience in rural communities and socio-economic systems in these two pilot district municipalities in South Africa, by working directly with local stakeholders and anticipated beneficiaries through a small granting mechanism. The overall goal of the project is to ensure that vulnerable, rural communities in the project target areas have reduced vulnerability and increased resilience to the anticipated impacts of climate variability and change. The objective is to incorporate climate adaptation response strategies into local practices so that assets, livelihoods and ecosystem services are protected from climate-induced risks associated with expected droughts, seasonal shifts and storm-related disaster events. The project will do so through three main components: The Community Adaptation SGF will be led by SouthSouthNorth (SSN) Trust, who will act as the Executing Entity (EE), and Conservation South Africa (CSA), who will act as the Facilitating Agency in the Namakwa District. The Facilitating Agency for the Mopani District is still to be selected.

Syrian Arab Republic/Asia-Pacific,Increasing the climate change resilience of communities in Eastern Ghouta in Rural Damascus to water scarcity challenges through integrated natural resource management and immediate adaptation interventions," The Syrian Arab Republic is highly vulnerable to the effects of global warming and climate change in its various dimensions. This is manifested in various climatic phenomena, but alarming are the increasing temperatures and droughts, already in the short term, and projected reduction of precipitation, mainly in the long term. The effects of these climatic phenomena impact all social and economic sectors and represent a threat to livelihoods, agricultural productivity, water availability and community health. The crisis has exacerbated these threats, since it led to a weak and deteriorating adaptive capacity resulted from damaged infrastructure, limited institutional capacity, rapid resettlement of displaced people, returnees and high level of poverty. This project aims to reduce vulnerabilities to water availability challenges in one of the most vulnerable areas in Syria: Eastern Ghouta. To manage water and land resources efficiently, also considering future climate change risks and population trends in this area, an integrated natural resource management strategy will be developed. Complementing the strategy, the proposed project will directly build the resilience of selected communities though the implementation of concrete no-regret adaptation activities including the treatment of wastewater which is currently pollution water resources in the area and the establishment of water efficient irrigation systems.

Tajikistan/Asia-Pacific,An integrated landscape approach to enhancing the climate resilience of small-scale farmers and pastoralists in Tajikistan,"The Republic of Tajikistan is the most climate-vulnerable country in Central Asia. Extreme rainfall events have become more frequent and intense, the rainfall season has shortened in many parts of the country, air temperatures have risen markedly, and glacial melting is accelerating. As a result, hydrometeorological disasters such as droughts, floods, mudflows and landslides are more frequent and rates of soil erosion across the country are increasing. The socio-economic impacts of these changes are considerable: livelihoods, agricultural productivity, water availability and hydroelectricity production are all compromised. The project aims to introduce an integrated approach to landscape management to develop the climate resilience of rural communities in Tajikistan. The project’s activities will focus in particular within one of the most climate-vulnerable river basins, namely the Kofirnighan River Basin (KRB).

"Tanzania, United Republic of/Africa",Strategic Water Harvesting Technologies for Enhancing Resilience to Climate Change in Rural Communities in Semi-Arid Areas of Tanzania (SWAHAT),"The objective of proposed SWAHAT project is enhancing resilience and adaptation of semi arid rural communities to climate change-induced impacts of drought, floods and water scarcity. This will be achieved through strategic water harvesting technologies that will contribute to improved crops, aquaculture and livestock productivity, reforestation as well as combating emerging crops and livestock pests and diseases. The conceptual design of the water harvesting dam has been designed to ensure afforestation of the catchment before the dam thus prevention excessive siltation. The constructed or rehabilitated dams will supply water for all the proposed resilience and adaptation enhancing integrated innovations to be implemented on the semi-arid landscapes. In addition, synergism between aquaculture and agricultural activities will be done to enhance nutrient recycling and improve resource use efficiency. Nursery for fruits and forest trees as well as vegetable gardens will be established and supply seedlings for afforestation and horticulture. Pastureland and animal husbandry infrastructure will be established downstream of the dam for improved productivity and supply of manure for soil fertility improvement. The afforested landscape will integrate apiary units, provide fuel wood and restore habitats for biodiversity conservation. All these integrated approaches will contribute to livelihoods diversification to improve adaptation and resilience capacity to climate change of the semi-arid communities and the surrounding ecosystem.

"Tanzania, United Republic of/Africa",Bunda Climate Resilience and Adaptation Project," The Bunda district represents the section of poor rural communities of the Mara region in Tanzania. There are highly dependent on rain fed subsistence agriculture, and are vulnerable to land degradation and forest resources due to poor farming practices, unsustainable charcoal production and fuel wood harvesting, declining fish stock, illegal and primitive fishing practices and livestock grazing aggravate the impacts of climate change on the communities’ livelihood systems, amplifying communities’ vulnerability and limiting their adaptive capacity. This project proposes to develop and implement concrete adaptation actions at grass root levels to increase community livelihood resilience to climate change effects and cover the following sectors: water resources and supply, agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, livestock, forestry and ecosystems and gender in relation to climate change. The project applies transformative integrated environmental management and aquaculture innovations, resilient rural water supply systems and Ever-Green-Agricultural (EVA) practices to reduce vulnerabilities and the impact of climate change on local communities in the district. This approach offers practical and effective combination of Community-Based-Adaption and Ecosystem-Based-Adaptation techniques to support transformation of livelihood system, combat poverty, enhance greater climate resilience of rural communities and gender equality while reducing emissions through long-term storage of carbon in landscapes. The anticipated impact of the project is to benefit 36,218 men and women.

"Tanzania, United Republic of/Africa",Enhancing Climate Change Resilience of Coastal Communities of Zanzibar,"In Zanzibar, one of the two countries that form the United Republic of Tanzania (URT), climate variability has caused prolonged dry periods and unpredictable rainfall pattern making crop cultivation unproductive. Freshwater resources are also in limited supply mainly dependent on seasonal rains that store water in inefficient groundwater aquifers consisting of freshwater lenses floating on the underlying seawater. Furthermore, increasing temperatures have occasionally caused seal level rise leading to saltwater intrusion in low-lying farm fields, notably rice farms. The project will progress activities geared towards enabling climate resilient livelihoods in climate impacted areas of Zanzibar. Thus, the project’s main objective is to build the capacity of smallholder farmers in tackling climate change impacts through practical and innovative solutions; that have concrete and tangible outputs.

"Tanzania, United Republic of/Africa",Enhancing Climate Change Adaptation for Agro-Pastoral Communities in Kongwa District,"With the emerging challenges of climate change and climate variability, many socio-economic sectors in Tanzania are vulnerable to climate related risks. These include water, where there is a general drying trend of natural water springs and rivers, energy where the hydropower performances are frequently interrupted by drought events, agriculture where crops and livestock suffer the impacts of drought and flooding and increasing occurrences of epidemics from pests and diseases in the health sector. In general, more than 70% of natural disasters in Tanzania are climate related. They are linked to droughts and floods and these have become more frequent as a result of climate change and climate variability. Several studies conducted in various regions and districts in the United Republic of Tanzania, indicate that rural areas especially agro-pastoral communities have been experiencing the effect of climate change through crop failures, decreased crop yields, increased water scarcity and sometimes shrinkage and drying of grazing lands/pastures due to increased and intensified drought periods. The predominance of more bad years as commonly referred by communities in rural areas of Tanzania have negatively impacted farmers‘ livelihoods, their economies and social life. In Kongwa district for example, worryingly, farmers are reporting that both the timing of rainy seasons and the pattern of rains within seasons are changing. These observations of change in climate are striking in that they are widespread throughout the district and are pronounced in remarkably consistent terms in almost all villages of the district.

Uganda/Africa,Enhancing resilience of communities to climate change through catchment-based integrated management of water and related resources in Uganda,"The major symptoms of climate change in Uganda include increase in temperatures and increased variability and unpredictability of rainfall patterns that lead to increased frequency and intensity of disasters such as floods and landslides. These have severe impacts on ecosystems, agricultural landscapes and livelihoods especially among the rural populations. In Uganda, climate change, waterrelated disasters, such as floods, landslides, windstorms and hailstorms, contribute over 70% of the natural disasters and destroy an average of 800,000 ha of crops, with economic losses of over USh 120 billion annually. Uganda’s economy and local communities are vulnerable to climate change and variability due to e.g. heavy reliance on natural resources, particularly within the agricultural sector, dependence on rain-fed agriculture, and close linkages between agricultural performance and climatic changes. As the total demand for water is expected to increase, establishing an integrated water management framework is an important response to the increased demand for water and uncertainties of climate change. The overall goal of the project is to increase the resilience of communities to the risk of floods and landslides in Awoja, Maziba and Aswa catchments through promoting catchment based integrated, equitable and sustainable management of water and related resources.

Along with the water resource management and coastal erosion issues, the lack of vertical and horizontal coordination has been bottlenecked for the community to reflect their needs to the provincial and national level policies. In the Mekong Delta, river water and ground water levels are decreasing, while sea levels, flood tides and salt intrusion are on the rise, the demand for water has also increased in production and daily activities due to industrialisation and population growth. The extraction of groundwater has increased rapidly over the past decades and forms one of the main causes of saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. This intrusion has been accelerated by the on-going sea level rise. Saltwater intrusion of groundwater in the Mekong Delta is a highly complex issue as it heavily depends on varying factors, including changes in water supplies, rising water demands, and the impact of climate change especially sea level rise, drought, and rising temperature. Because of saltwater intrusion of the groundwater, a growing number of provinces in the Mekong Delta are also experiencing depleted and degraded freshwater supplies for drinking and domestic use especially in dry season.
