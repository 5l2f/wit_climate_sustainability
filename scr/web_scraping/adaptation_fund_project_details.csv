In fact, climate trends over the previous 90 years have already indicated a significant warming trend. The summer season has become dryer and the number of extreme events, like hailstorms, has increased. Different climate change scenarios predict that this trend will continue to increase and substantially affect the marginal production areas. Crop and livestock production have already decreased in some areas, and if no additional climate adaptation measures were taken, will continue to decrease. Notably areas and communities adjacent to protected areas and forests – like Khosrov Forest State Reserve and Dilijan National Park – are vulnerable due to a persistent pressure on the remaining land and pasture resources, weak rural infrastructure and the lack of alternative income opportunities. The existing capacity to adapt to a changing climate and its increasing impacts on the rural livelihoods and their production systems is low, calling for concerted efforts to addresses the compounding challenges of land degradation and climate change impacts on rural livelihoods. The objective of the project is to reduce the climate risk vulnerability of local communities living adjacent to the “Khosrov Forest” and “Dilijan” National Park by strengthening the adaptive capacity of the agricultural sector and reinforcing their institutional and planning capacity for climate change adaptation.

These gewogs have been identified as priorities for intervention under the government’s “water flagship programme” due to their specific vulnerabilities exacerbated by climate change that need to be specifically addressed through targeted water and agricultural adaptation activities. These gewogs, put together, have a total population of 36,464 and cover a total area of 1,403sq km. The project for climate resilience building in water stressed communities in Bhutan proposes an articulated approach that will lead to healthier ecosystems and improved associated services, better management of water use for human activities, improved information systems and decision-making, and linking with the most relevant level of governance. Issues related to water availability and use all along the watershed, the various components of sustainability (including at technical, financial and institutional level), and the participation of the beneficiaries are key aspects of the project. Expected impacts of climate change will place additional stress on ecosystem-based livelihoods and on already vulnerable groups. As such, the project will focus on local level adaptation, increasing potential benefits for exposed or sensitive groups, and act as a force for change towards the foreseen improvements at different levels. The project aims to benefit 36,464 people directly and rehabilitate 21,251 hectares of natural habitats.  ",,

Agricultural productivity is therefore expected to decrease because of increased temperature and more frequent precipitation extremes. The projected increase in dry spells could also lead to reduced availability of water for irrigation during the dry months of the year. As a consequence of changing patterns and more frequent extreme events, the overall stability of production and external supply, as well as incomes from agricultural activities could be reduced by future climate change. The project proposes the implementation of a set of concrete adaptation interventions targeted to 3 profitable agricultural production systems (rice, cassava and cocoa) in the Bandama basin. The project will support the provision of data, information and knowledge to support decisions taken by farmers in choosing appropriate adaptation measures combined with direct support through extension services to ensure rapid adoption and scaling-up to the largest number of recipients. The project will also address the enabling environment by looking into the optimum institutional setting and collaboration from Ministries down to farmer organizations. The project intends to reduce the projected direct effects of the negative impacts of climate change on 15,600 smallholder farmers including 5,000 rice producers, 5,600 cassava producers and 4,000 cocoa producers, 1,000 from other enterprises/cooperatives of which at least 45 % will be women and 40 % young people; and indirectly benefiting 93,600 beneficiaries  (45% will be women) through improved regulatory systems, increased access in climate resilient planting materials, and better access to market and other downstream effects.

The coastal area is also increasingly affected by strong winds, which are often associated with the onset of thunderstorms. Increases in sea levels are especially alarming for Cambodia’s coastal areas that are already experiencing severe seawater intrusion, beach erosion, high tides, and frequent storm surges. Additional impacts such as land subsidence in the region may even further intensify its effects. In addition, substantial saltwater incursion and coastal erosion has been observed throughout the coastal area, including in all eight of the target communes. Considering the topography of the area; primarily flat coastal plain, characterised by rice paddy and poor settlements, erosion and seawater incursion is having a substantial impact on the ability of people to source their livelihoods. The main objective of the project is to enhance climate change adaptation and resilience of the most vulnerable coastal human settlements of Cambodia through concrete climate change adaptation actions, particularly in areas where ecotourism has the potential to sustain such interventions. To achieve this objective, the project focuses its actions on highly vulnerable settlements in Kep Province and Prey Nob District of Preah Sihanouk Province. The anticipated impact of the project will be reflected in the Kep Province, where the project will target four sangkats/communes, with a total of 28,021 direct beneficiaries of the project’s interventions, and in Prey Nob District (in Preah Sihanouk Province) targeting seven communes, with a total of 34,500 beneficiaries.

Impacts of climatic events are experienced inversely on both coasts: in other words, while droughts take place on the Pacific slope, floods are suffered on the Caribbean slope. Climate change impacts have created challenges for the agricultural and fisheries sectors – and will continue to do so. Previous national adaptation experiences in the agricultural and fisheries sectors have shown the need to adapt the food systems rather than only focusing on its long-term transformation. The Adapta2+ experience has shown that the slow shift from traditional agricultural food value chains and agricultural practices to sustainable food production and consumption patterns will occur and will last by engaging governments, farmers, agro-industry, retailers and consumers. The program highlights the importance of enabling conditions for farmers and fishers of the private sector to increase local resilience to ensure the long-term impacts of the adaptation strategies. The need to reinforce local markets based on value chains for farmers, fishers and MSMEs, especially led by women, have been identified to upscale its results. Joining farmers, fishers, businesses along the value chain, community-based organizations, and local and national governments to work together would allow strengthening local markets. Hence, escalating the existing finance options and creating new ones for the private sector would support the transformation of the agriculture sector and MSMEs. To do so, training and supporting finance institutions is key to show the profitability of financing adaptation. Building capacities in finance institutions also ensures the long-term impact and continuity of the program and its benefits. For its implementation, the program is based on the six planning regions of Costa Rica, defined by the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy (MIDEPLAN), and their corresponding counties. The project aims to benefit 4,000 producers (farmers and fishers), at least 50% are women; additionally, it will produce capacity building and dissemination of knowledge activities for at least 10,000 people (50% women); and provide around 230 loans granted to producers, MSMEs, and organizations within the six planning regions.

Many small-scale farmers cannot feed their families adequately, as they have little or no access to capital, markets, or effective farming techniques and infrastructure. In the Olmedo community, for example, 90 percent of residents live below the poverty line and 40 percent are malnourished. At the same time, increasing population levels and the corresponding need for land have forced people to overexploit forests and to plant their crops on soil with high erosion rates. Poverty forces people to occupy unsafe areas most prone to natural disasters and increased population density is leaving more people exposed to reductions in water flows, decreased crop yields and ongoing environmental damage. Other factors contributing to vulnerability include lack of awareness of climate-related threats, the construction of homes on fragile land, and the inadequate quality of infrastructure and construction materials.

The current situation showcases the lack of broad economic strength, low levels of diversification and technology, with direct consequences to flexible and effective adaptation. The South-Ahuachapán region is an area of high vulnerability to climate change. Considering its environmental and social characteristics at the landscape level, this part of the country finds itself highly susceptible to the destructive effects of climate variability together with lacking of necessary resources to adequately prepare, respond and recover from natural disasters. This region, contains a significant amount of the population exposed to frequent meteorological drought, while at the same time it is one of El Salvador’s main regions for the production of staple food items (basic grains), as well as other cash crops (sugarcane, coffee).  The San Francisco Menendez municipality is part of the broader South Ahuachapán landscape. The proposed project has the main objective of reducing the vulnerability of communities and productive ecosystems in the Municipality of San Francisco Menendez to drought risk, soil erosion, and flash floods due to climate change and climate variability as described above. The project will meet this objective by addressing the main barriers that have been identified as limiting the capacity of ecosystems and rural communities in San Francisco Menendez to adapt to climate change. The project will integrate forest landscape restoration as a climate change adaptation strategy targeted towards increasing forest cover, improving the hydrological cycle, increasing the amount of available water, and regulating surface and groundwater flows, while maintaining and improving water supply and quality.

The high proportion of rain-fed crop production makes the sector very sensitive to rainfall variability. Productivity has historically been constrained by rainfall variability and extremes, low soil fertility and land/soil degradation. Erosion of topsoil and failure to return organic matter contributes further to soil deterioration. Ethiopia also has a large livestock population (the largest in Africa); livestock is a source of local income in the highlands (where mixed farming systems are often used) and in lowlands/pastoral farming systems, where livestock are a critical part of livelihoods and the principal capital of farmers. Over 80% of agricultural holders practice mixed systems. Critically, both agriculture and livestock sectors are heavily impacted by the frequent major droughts and floods. Drought is a critical climate related hazard in Ethiopia, frequently occurring in many parts of the country. A large part of Ethiopia  is dryland, where annual rainfall is low and seasonal and inter-annual variability is high. These areas are highly vulnerable; desertification and drought have been a persistent problem throughout history, with associated food shortages and famine. Floods are the other major climate related hazard in the country. Major floods – leading to loss of life and property – have occurred in different parts of the country although there are much more common smaller events.

The island nation experiences frequent cyclones (on average, one cyclone per year) and with them damaging winds, rain and storm surges. Besides cyclones, the country suffers from other extreme events associated with climate change such as extreme rainfall, flooding, droughts and temperature extremes as well as sea-level rise. Being mountainous in its interior, cities and towns are mainly located on the coast and along rivers. The result is that Fiji’s towns and cities are particularly exposed to seaborne and riverine natural hazards, cyclones, storm surges, coastal and riverine erosion, landslides, floods and already occurring sea level rise due to climate change. Mangrove deforestation and coral reef extraction in order to accommodate urban development and for reasons of income generation are increasing the vulnerability of urban areas to coastal hazards, as both mangrove forests and coral reefs provide effective barriers against storm surges and cyclones. Of particularly critical concern are the residents of informal settlements in towns and cities as many such settlements are located in highly vulnerable areas, such as riverbanks and pockets of coastal land. The project will focus on informal settlements across four urban areas and towns in Fiji: Lautoka, Sigatoka, Nadi and Lami, which are located in the Greater Suva Urban Area.

Other sources of degradation, such as over-extraction of woodland trees, uncontrolled bushfires, and production of charcoal results in loss of vegetation cover, leading to widespread soil erosion and sediment transfer into the Gambia River. Land degradation is increasingly exacerbated by salinization. In addition to climate-related risks, systemic and persistent gender inequalities in access to water are further challenges to developing food security and climate-resilient agriculture in The Gambia. Post-harvest losses, inadequate storage, limited value-addition and weak marketing are further barriers to food security. The above inter-linked vulnerabilities frequently serve as barriers to climate change adaptation in The Gambia, and need targeted strategies to overcome them. The overall goal of this project is to enhance adaptive capacity of rural populations in The Gambia through support to climate-resilient and diversified livelihoods. The target group of the Rural Integrated Climate Adaptation and Resilience Building Project (RICAR) for concrete adaptation activities is smallholder farmers and other vulnerable rural groups, who are already at risk from climate variability and change, with an emphasis on women and youth. The project focuses on a limited number of localities in order to maximize impact in two of the country’s six regions, namely Upper River Region (URR) and Central River Region (CRR). Both regions are highly climate vulnerable, with high levels of poverty, chronic food insecurity, malnutrition, and environmental degradation. They experience considerable barriers to adaptation to climate change impacts, yet have the potential for increased climate-resilient agricultural production, as they have relatively fertile lowland soil, and for livelihood diversification. The anticipated impact of the project is to benefit at least 30 percent of the population in the two regions of URR and CRR, or 168,000 people, through climate services, knowledge, awareness raising and enhanced adaptation planning activities. Of these 168,000 people, 63,000 will benefit directly from concrete resilience building and adaptation measures, diversified livelihoods developed through value chain and marketing support, and new community-based adaptation plans for their villages. 45,000 of the direct beneficiaries will benefit from activities to increase access to financial services (financial literacy, savings, micro-finance and micro insurance) to enhance investments in climate-resilient agriculture.

The cumulative effect of sea level rise and increased intensity of cyclonic storms has lead to salinization of land and water resources. According to an estimate, a total area of 35,000 ha of prime agriculture land in coastal Andhra Pradesh will become saline due to sea level rise alone which will lead to lesser productivity of land resources and, in turn, reduce income and increase poverty in vulnerable coastal areas. Objectives: The aim of the project is to overcome the consequences of salinization and other impacts of the coastal area due to sea level rise and seawater inundation due to increased cyclonic storms and storm surges through appropriate adaptation strategies such as restoration of degraded mangroves and demonstration of Integrated Mangrove Fishery Farming System (IMFFS). Restoration of mangroves will be taken up in degraded, saline and unprotected mangrove areas located in Revenue Department land and thus, it will serve as a model for management of similar areas of unprotected mangroves. Restoration of degraded mangroves will be undertaken with native multiple mangrove species to improve the health of the mangrove forest, which in turn, will avoid ingression of seawater. It is proven that an increase in the height of the mangrove substratum is almost equal to predicted annual increase in sea level. The mangrove ecosystem will help to build the land through sedimentation of suspended solids in the root zone preventing exposure of land, water, other coastal resources and livelihood assets to saline water inundation. IMFFS will be demonstrated in lands owned by small aqua farms so that it can be a model for other farmers both to sustain income from fish farming as well as improve protection from cyclonic storms. IMFFS will also increase the opportunity to integrate both physical security against sea level rise and livelihood security of the coastal community. The raised bunds of this farming system are planned to act as embankments protecting coastal villages from salt water intrusion during storm surges.The executing entity of the project is M. S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF), supported by Praja Pragathi Seva Sangam (PPSS). MSSRF has worked in the region for several years and restored more than 450 ha of degraded mangroves.

The country’s fragile mountain topography, combined with depletion of forest cover, results in wind and water soil erosion on sloping lands. Other interrelated problems relate to risks of landslides, mudflows and flooding due to poor storage basin management, unsustainable use of water resources and deterioration of water quality due to sedimentation. The intensity of erosion is primarily due to water-runoff, soil sedimentation and harmful agricultural practices utilized on sloping land. The Kyrgyz forestry sector confronts other threats as well. The lack of timber imports into the country, overgrazing on forested lands and the steady growth of population, all put increasing pressure on Kyrgyz forests. Over the last thirty years, forest cover has been reduced by at least 50 percent. Intensive livestock grazing has had a significant effect on forests, with almost one million ha of forestland being used for grazing. Pastures are overgrazed in the low and middle altitudes due to inappropriate herd management and stocking rates. The project goal is to contribute to rural poverty alleviation in the country through increased climate resilience, incomes and gender-sensitive growth in rural farming communities. The proposed Regional Resilient Pastoral Communities Project – ADAPT promotes climate-adaptive resilience through a targeted approach to reduce rangeland and forest degradation and to actively improve the condition of these interlinked ecosystems. The project will mainstream participatory, sustainable, forest and rangeland management for the stakeholders in the forests and rangelands of Kyrgyzstan. This project upscales the lessons learned and best practices from a number of preceding projects namely the IFAD LMDP I & II and ATMP projects; the World Bank / GEF – IFEMP; FAO / GEF – Sustainable management of mountainous forest and land resources under climate change conditions; the GIZ Ecosystem-based Adaptation to Climate Change in High Mountainous Regions of Central Asia; and the IFAD BALI pilot. The AF will target around 23 Pasture User Unions (PUUs) to improve the climate-resilience of their pastures. The RRPCP-Adapt will target Leskhozes in climate-vulnerable areas that were not targeted by the World Bank Integrated Forest Ecosystem Management Project (IFEMP) project. Given that PUUs generally comprise between 850 and 1,000 member households (with an average size of 5.3 persons per household), IFAD assumes a total outreach of 109,710 persons (20,700 households), of which 50% will be women.

Its population of over 100,000 people is largely dependent on ecosystem services (e.g. nearshore fisheries, coastal protection) for their livelihoods, both for subsistence and as sources of incomes. More than 80% of communities in the FSM are vulnerable to sea-level rise and flooding, given that most villages and settlements are situated in either coastal areas or in areas around rivers and streams. Furthermore, clear declines in fishing success have been observed, caused by increasing subsistence and commercial harvesting, the demise of traditional management over the last decades and the impacts of climate change. These trends threaten long-term sustainability of these fisheries and the fundamental role they provide for local food and economic security. The overall goal of the multisector adaptation project is to build the ecological, social and economic resilience of communities in the FSM through practical solutions for reducing community vulnerability to climate change stressors. The project aims to ensure that all four State Governments and the National Government in the FSM have the mechanisms in place to develop and successfully implement a robust nearshore fisheries management and nationwide protected areas network inclusive of proper enforcement and sustainable finance mechanisms. The project also seeks to provide communities with the resources and support needed to implement successful eco-based adaptation actions to protect their marine ecosystems and increase resilience to climate change impacts.

However, in many areas the dissolved solids content of the locally available groundwater exceeds the approved threshold for human consumption. Decreased aquifer recharge due to periods of lower rainfall caused by climate change is likely to cause an increase in total dissolved solids in groundwater, which will exacerbate the water quality situation. Pumping water over long distances from other water sources is not a feasible option for supplying small communities with good quality water. An alternative is to improve the quality of locally abstracted groundwater by applying treatment techniques. These techniques require energy in the form of electricity, but many of the small communities are not coupled to the national electricity grid. It is also considered that the energy needs for treatment should be met by sustainable and environmentally sound resources. The objective of the project is to pilot the treatment by reverse osmosis (RO) of poor quality local groundwater to a level that complies with the national standards for drinking water, using sun and wind energy to power the process. Execution of the project will yield a wide range of information and knowledge on both technical and social aspects of establishing and operating such treatment and power plants. The acquired information, knowledge and skills will then be communicated to stakeholders in the water supply sector in order that the applied technology could be mainstreamed and replicated elsewhere in the country. The project will result in improved resilience of vulnerable communities and groups to climate change impact, specifically to a decrease in chemical water quality of existing groundwater sources. In addition to providing benefits to vulnerable communities in the target areas, the project will also serve to increase the capacity of government agencies to integrate climate change adaptation considerations into water supply planning and policy processes.

Due to the impacts of climate change, the activity of raising camelids by vulnerable Andean highlands communities in Peru has been being severely affected, with cyclical annual losses in thousands of heads of camelids, which threatens the sustainability of these communities’ principal livelihood. Within the Peruvian territory the effects of climate change also differ, by region and socioeconomic levels, and, in the distribution of negative climate impacts, the rural poor of highland mountain ecosystems will bear the brunt of these changes. In these areas, glacier retreat has reduced the availability of water and has led to the desertification and soil degradation.

The main driving factor for this enormous productivity is the physical and chemical characteristics of its coastal upwelling, which allow the efficient growth of primary producers, high survival rates of larvae and the efficient trophic transfer to foraging fish and top predators. The scope of this proposal encompasses these two coastal marine ecosystems: the Peruvian Coastal Upwelling Ecosystem (PCUE) and the Tropical Eastern Pacific Coastal Ecosystem. The two targeted ecosystems are subject of significant climatic variability that range from the interannual scale (El Niño Southern Oscillation, ENSO) to the scale of decades or centuries, as palaeoclimatic research has revealed. For example, during strong El Niño events, the warm and nutrient-poor water masses extend along the coast and the overall coastal productivity decrease. Due to thermal stress and scarcity of food sources, anchovy populations become highly vulnerable and experience high natural mortality. Meanwhile, warm-water, tropical fish species migrate along the coast. The opposite responses occur during the cool La Niña events. Therefore the climatic ecological impacts can have dramatic socio-economic consequences for the fishing industry and for the artisanal fishing communities. The main challenge consists in increasing the resilience of the coastal marine ecosystems and the coastal communities (particularly the artisanal fishing communities) to climate change impacts. The main beneficiaries of this project are the artisanal fishing communities, whose livelihoods largely depends on the status of the coastal marine ecosystems, which are already subject to a number of non-climatic threats.

The loss of vegetation in this region has contributed to high rates of soil erosion causing landslides and flooding during periods of heavy rainfall, and siltation of rivers and in the mangroves, impacting directly in the sectors of tourism, agriculture, and commerce. While the situation is slightly different throughout the Atlantic Coast of Belize, Guatemala and Honduras, key drivers for loss and degradation of forest cover outside protected areas in the region include the clearing of forest for annual crops, cattle ranching, and firewood extraction. In addition, it presents similar disproportionate exposure to extreme weather events, vulnerability of local populations, common bio-physical conditions, and relative isolation from regions inland. For optimal solutions to the threat from climate extremes, the coastal areas of the three countries of the Gulf of Honduras need to be treated as a single region. The objective of the project is to strengthen the climate resilience of communities and the ecosystems in the target area by deploying nature-based restoration efforts in a gender-conscious manner, providing access to community tools and training, supporting local/ community early warning systems, and implementing a regional approach that enhance scaling up possibilities for restoration ecosystems as an adaptation measures the Gulf of Honduras. The project aims to benefit 2,050 individuals directly and more than 35,000 indirectly, it will also provide the countries with early warning systems for improving alerts and response capacities to extreme weather events. Additionally, it targets to promote learning and sharing through the collection of lessons and experiences, which CABEI can be later use for replication throughout the region.     ",,

In Sri Lanka, the project will focus on districts in the dry zone, while targeted areas in India will be the dry districts within the states of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The targeted areas in both countries share similar climate risks, agro-ecological conditions and socio-economic vulnerabilities. Climate change impacts already affecting the project areas in Sri Lanka and India include delayed monsoon rains, increased average temperature leading to more heat stress, more variable rainfall, and increased frequency of heatwaves and droughts, which result in reduced food and water security, as well as adverse effects on human health, natural ecosystems and biodiversity. In the targeted areas in India, agriculture is primarily rain-fed, with the majority of farmers dependent on the monsoon for irrigating their crops. Over-reliance on the monsoon poses uncertainties for food production and rural incomes as droughts, floods and variation in rainfall pattern greatly affect the agricultural sector. While vulnerability to increased droughts through climate change is widespread throughout Sri Lanka, it is concentrated in the Dry and Intermediate Zones.Changes in the northeast monsoon seasonal rainfall compared to the base line climatology clearly indicate decreasing rainfall, especially in the dry zone. The combination of changed average conditions and increased extreme weather events is resulting in the growing climate risks in the target regions in both India and Sri Lanka. The project’s main goal is to strengthen the climate change adaptive capacity and food security of vulnerable communities in Sri Lanka’s dry zone and India’s eastern coastal states, utilizing a regional, integrated approach. Leveraging differentiated skills and experience in the two countries, and using participatory and bottom-up approaches, the project will enable vulnerable groups to use last mile climate services to plan and implement targeted adaptation measures best suited for different livelihoods and localities, supplemented by livelihoods diversification and enhanced linkages to existing financial services. A regional feedback loop will provide valuable real-time lessons for scaling up and out, both within and beyond the two countries.

It has experienced severe drought and increasing deterioration of soil quality and vegetation cover and the scarcity of natural resources has led to conflict and migration. More than elsewhere, in the Sahel these natural disasters are degrading the natural resources essential to the agropastoral livelihoods that underpin the economy in much of the area 80 to 90 percent of the population actively engage in agriculture. Drought deteriorates land causing it to lose its fertility. Insufficient rain-fed irrigation means that crops fail or are destroyed, while livestock struggle to find water for drinking. In order to tackle the climate-driven challenges, countries in the Sahel region have laid out their national priorities to adapt to climate change and committed to limit the impacts of climate change through specific adaptation measures. The proposed project proposal focuses those sectors that have been identified as being of national adaptive importance for both countries, namely agriculture, water resources, livestock and land resources. The project objective is to strengthen the regional agro-ecology and sanitation resilience to climate change and COVID-19 in the border area between Chad and Sudan. This will be achieved by enhancing regional water mapping, monitoring and governance capacity to better adapt to drought events; by improving water availability, water use efficiency; promoting adaptive agriculture production systems and multipurpose water technologies for improved livelihoods, food security and sanitation of rural households; and developing a Regional Natural Resource Management Plan. By adopting a regional approach, the project will enable the two countries to reap the full benefits of the potential spill-over effects of a shared scale-up strategy in the most cost-effective way. A regional approach for irrigation development will help: (a) facilitate coordinated investment planning in shared natural resource areas; (b) build the knowledge base and facilitate cross-learning at the regional level; and (c) facilitate the development of regional and national policies. In total the project will target around 23,000 direct beneficiaries plus and additional 115,000 indirect as household members (on average around 6 members to a household). Around 20,000 beneficiaries will benefit from learning of climate-resilient rainfed agriculture techniques through Farmer Field Schools that will improve their ability to maximise agricultural productivity and improve soil fertility in harsh climatic conditions.

The Goascorán watershed, like other areas within the Central American Dry Corridor, is highly vulnerable to climate variability and change, with exposure to extreme weather events and high poverty rates creating specific challenges. The main climatic factors in the region are delayed onset of the rainy season, erratic rainfalls, increasing frequency and intensity of droughts during the growing season, excessive rains and severe flooding. Loss and damages from extreme weather events like tropical storms and hurricanes affect communities in the watershed. Eighty-five percent of the watershed population lives in rural areas. Households depend on cultivation of maize, sorghum and beans, and livestock raising including small-scale aviculture. Because of the limited agricultural potential of soils, cattle raising remains the primary option to generate income for smallholder producers in the upper and middle parts of the watershed. On both the Honduran and El Salvadoran sides of the watershed, the incidence of malnutrition ranges from moderate to high. Land tenure is a major challenge to achieve food security and strengthen livelihoods’ resilience in the watershed. Women are particularly vulnerable due to lower access to productive assets. The project’s main goal is to strengthen the climate change adaptive capacity of vulnerable households in the degraded transboundary watershed of Goascorán across El Salvador and Honduras by providing communities with integrated climate risk management tools and services that enhance their resilience to climate variability and change. The project will support the adoption and dissemination of traditional and innovative climate-resilient practices and technologies within a gender-transformative integrated approach. Groups that will be targeted include smallholder agricultural cooperatives involved in food production and processing, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), Local Development Committees, community leaders, technicians and extension agents, intermediaries in agriculture value chains, participants in farmer field schools, along with educational centers and schools and members of communities in the prioritized municipalities, aiming to benefit 275,000 individuals.

Produced by low-income smallholders across the entire region, rice plays a key role in regional food security for rural and urban populations. In recent years, increasing demand stemming from population growth and steady increases in annual per capita consumption has outpaced production, leading to ever-increasing rice imports from Asia, accounting for 46% of total rice consumption in 2017. As rice production is practiced across the entire region in all climate zones and is dominantly rainfed, key risks from the increasing variability of climate events will result in the disruption of the growing season calendars, shortening of the cropping season, and exacerbated dry spells, droughts, and heatwaves. It will also create greater likelihoods of floods, shortage of irrigation water, strong winds and storms, and changes in incidences and geographic range of pests and diseases – all of which can lead to substantial rice yield reductions or crop failure. By using the Climate-Resilient Rice Production (CRRP) approach proposed on this project, the Rice Offensive can address several critical challenges simultaneously: respond to increasing rice consumption needs, strengthen livelihoods of rice farming communities, allow for diversification of economic activities along the rice value chain, improve the overall national economic well-being, free up hard currency – previously used for rice imports – for other national needs, and contribute to political stability. Promoting adaptation to the  climate change threats. The RICOWAS project preparation has taken the SRI-WAAPP results into account and is designed to build on these achievements. The RICOWAS project will focus on scaling up CRRP as an adaptation measure to different and location-specific climate threats. It will also contribute directly to the objectives of the Rice Offensive as specified in the Regional Agricultural Policy for West Africa (ECOWAP) of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The global objective of the project is to improve climate resilience and increase rice system productivity of smallholder rice farmers across West Africa using a climate-resilient rice production approach. The project aims to reach around 153,000 rice growers and indirectly benefit around 1.5 million people.   ",,

However, some urban areas, especially in Lebanon and Jordan, experience extreme pressure on water availability, both in quantity and quality, exacerbated by climate change, the unprecedented influx of Displaced Persons (DPs) especially from Syria, and groundwater over extraction and pollution challenges. The overall aim of this project is to better respond to climate change impacts and vulnerabilities in the context of the Syrian crisis in Jordan and Lebanon. This is done by demonstrating what concrete adaptation measures  respond to the needs of both DPs and host communities, and especially women and youth, while avoiding any tension over resources and employment opportunities. The project will focus on responding to climate change-related water challenges by taking a sustainable water management approach. This means it aims to reduce the demand of unsustainable water sources such as over-extracted (and often polluted) groundwater, while increasing water supply options from non- conventional and more sustainable sources, including, rainwater harvesting and the reuse of treated waste water.

These shortages are related to droughts, which result in decreased agricultural yields, threatening food security through the sub-region. Furthermore, the income-generating capacity of water-dependent livelihood activities including freshwater fishing is reduced. Apart from declining incomes and livelihood options, decreased water availability in the GMS is detrimental to human and ecosystem health, leading to major humanitarian disasters in the region.  A decrease in the production of the region’s main staple, rice, is particularly problematic and as a result, prices will rise, which will further impact the lives and livelihoods of the GMS’s economically marginalized communities.

The main objective of the project is to assist the six countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Mali and Togo) in the implementation of coordinated and joint measures to improve their existing management plans at regional, national and local level and to build on the lessons learned from the past and current projects related to disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation. As droughts and floods are a common feature in the Volta basin region, integrated water resources management, risk maps and development of early warning systems must be implemented to increase resilience to floods and droughts to ensure socio-economic sustainable development. Equilibrated management of the water resources will be sought to make better use of the water surplus during floods to be stored in view of drought events. Furthermore, at local scale, agricultural production will be tailored to these challenges with provision of knowledge and early warnings that will enable farmers to adapt their production methods.

With a rapidly increasing population in the range of 250 million people, the region is experiencing more variable surface water flows, a prolonged dry season and intensifying droughts and a growing demand for water resources including groundwater. Despite relatively abundant surface water resources, a considerable number of low-income groups and urban/rural communities rely on low-cost groundwater for their domestic, agrarian and industrial use. Several groundwater reserves are transboundary, and it is recognised that there is limited capacity to manage these shared resources and limited knowledge about the sustainable yields of these transboundary aquifers. Due to rapid economic and population growth, pressures on groundwater in the region are increasing fast. In the recent past over-extraction of groundwater for production of high-value crops, such as coffee, has caused a severe drop in groundwater levels in parts of the Vietnamese highlands. The same is happening in the upstream part of the Mekong Delta (Cambodia) were rice production for export causes unsustainable use of groundwater. Intensification of irrigation to meet the food demand of growing populations rapidly increases use of groundwater in all countries in the region. In some areas such as southern Cambodia, parts of Lao PDR and the Mekong and Ayeyarwady Deltas, naturally occurring arsenic contamination is already exacerbated by increased groundwater use and higher pumping rates. Throughout the GMS, complex relationships occur between upstream recharge areas and downstream aquifers. This proposal seeks to address this institutional and governance challenge through implementing a transboundary groundwater collaboration. The objective is to establish effective regional capacities, partnerships and network in the Greater Mekong Subregion for the sustainable management and utilization of groundwater resources as an adaptation response to protect people, livelihoods, and ecosystems from climate change impacts. The project aims to benefit around 1.5 million people indirectly, it also targets to create a groundwater community of practice (CoP) of around 20 experts, equipped with the skills to ensure technical and management capabilities. Additionally, it will support the regulatory framework to manage resources and expand new groundwater-based resilience strategies and practical interventions by proposing either primary or secondary legislations in the targeted countries.

The large number of people farming on Rwanda’s hilly and mountainous terrain has led to serious environmental degradation due to overexploitation of the soil and extensive erosion. The farmed Northern and Western uplands of Rwanda are considered the most vulnerable to erosion due to their steeper terrain and higher annual rainfall. In addition to these unsustainable farming practices, there has been significant unplanned settlement in fragile and sensitive areas. Recent changes in the variability of rainfall have had a dramatic effect on these already highly perturbed ecosystems particularly in the mountainous North West part of the country which has experienced floods and landslides. Objectives: The objective of the project is to increase the adaptive capacity of natural systems and rural communities living in exposed areas of North Western Rwanda to climate change impacts. The strategy of the project is to manage the risks and effects from recurring floods, landslides and erosion through an integrated natural resource management and alternative livelihoods programme in one of the most climate sensitive and vulnerable areas of Rwanda. The project aims to address factors that exacerbate the effects of intense rainfall and lead to flooding and landslides. These include erosion and unsustainable farming practices linked to demographic pressure on natural resources. By introducing erosion and flood control measures, building the capacity of farmers to adapt to climate variability and supporting the development of off-farm livelihoods to reduce the pressure on natural resources, the project will restore the ecosystem functions necessary to reduce the incidence and severity of flooding and landslides on local communities and resources.

After the beach was submerged, the largest tour operator in the Senegalese village departed and hotel room prices fell. As the number of tourists dwindled, so did the household incomes of Saly Portudal’s many local craftsmen. Erosion and salt-water flooding has destroyed rice fields, damaged docks and buildings, and caused silt buildups that hamper transit between rivers and the sea.

According to local scale analysis of historical trends and future projections, there is a distinct warming trend for both Mopani and Namakwa, which will be far more severe by 2050 if global mitigation efforts are unsuccessful. Rainfall changes are much less certain, with temporal and spatial variability. Yet in historical trends there are indications of an increase in the intensity of heavy rainfall events in both areas, evident through a decrease in the number of rain days coupled with an unchanged average annual rainfall. Warming, and the associated increase in the number of extremely warm days, is set to impact evaporation rates and water availability. This is a concern as water is already scarce in Namakwa and in parts of Mopani. Greater amplitude of dry and wet spells, along with increasing temperatures, will negatively impact already stressed communities in both areas – thus rendering them more vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability and change, more specifically droughts, seasonal shifts and storm-related disaster events. Climate-related risks are generally greater for disadvantaged, rural and poor communities because of limited adaptive capacity and greater sensitivity to climate-driven impacts. Both Mopani and Namakwa Districts are characterized by the prevalence of rural, poor communities vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability and change. This threat requires climate finance for adaptation activities to find its way to these most vulnerable communities. However, such communities typically lack the capacity required to access the necessary funding. The project thus entails the implementation of a small grant finance mechanism to address this financial, capacity and adaptation need.

Mullaitivu District regularly experiences droughts, floods, strong winds and lightning and being a coastal area is open to the threat of coastal hazards. The salinity of water is increased during the drought period with inundations, saltwater intrusion, resulting in lack of drinking water and water for agriculture, pollution of waterways, wells, decreasing agricultural crop yields, seasonal increases in waterborne diseases and increased soil erosion from heavy rainfall events. These have caused significant loss to property, agricultural land, irrigation channels and built infrastructure etc. on a number of occasions over several years. In addition, Mullaitivu is one of the Districts with socioeconomic resilience to disasters is less than or equal to 30%, indicating that the average resident of Mullaitivu District struggles to cope with and recover from shocks when they occur. This struggle results in a lower likelihood of recovery in the long-term, and is due to a complex of factors, such as, poverty incidence, diversity of income sources, financial inclusion, and social protection enrollment, the net effects of which, wellbeing losses are designed to measure. The proposed project introduces effective drought, saltwater intrusion, and other preparedness measures to reduce risk levels in Mullaitivu District and increase adaptive capacities and resilience of the most vulnerable sections of the communities. The overall objective of the proposed project is to support climate resilient development and increase capacity for climate change adaptation of target communities living in the Mullaitivu District. This will be done by improving climate related socio-economic outcomes in the targeted fishing and agricultural communities through the implementation of community-based adaptation solutions; and by supporting climate resilient development and increase institutional and community capacity to adapt to the changing and variable climate.

The crisis has exacerbated these threats, since it led to a weak and deteriorating adaptive capacity resulted from damaged infrastructure, limited institutional capacity, rapid resettlement of displaced people, returnees and high level of poverty. This project aims to reduce vulnerabilities to water availability challenges in one of the most vulnerable areas in Syria: Eastern Ghouta. To manage water and land resources efficiently, also considering future climate change risks and population trends in this area, an integrated natural resource management strategy will be developed. Complementing the strategy, the proposed project will directly build the resilience of selected communities though the implementation of concrete no-regret adaptation activities including the treatment of wastewater which is currently pollution water resources in the area and the establishment of water efficient irrigation systems.

This will be achieved through strategic water harvesting technologies that will contribute to improved crops, aquaculture and livestock productivity, reforestation as well as combating emerging crops and livestock pests and diseases. The conceptual design of the water harvesting dam has been designed to ensure afforestation of the catchment before the dam thus prevention excessive siltation. The constructed or rehabilitated dams will supply water for all the proposed resilience and adaptation enhancing integrated innovations to be implemented on the semi-arid landscapes. In addition, synergism between aquaculture and agricultural activities will be done to enhance nutrient recycling and improve resource use efficiency. Nursery for fruits and forest trees as well as vegetable gardens will be established and supply seedlings for afforestation and horticulture. Pastureland and animal husbandry infrastructure will be established downstream of the dam for improved productivity and supply of manure for soil fertility improvement. The afforested landscape will integrate apiary units, provide fuel wood and restore habitats for biodiversity conservation. All these integrated approaches will contribute to livelihoods diversification to improve adaptation and resilience capacity to climate change of the semi-arid communities and the surrounding ecosystem.

These include water, where there is a general drying trend of natural water springs and rivers, energy where the hydropower performances are frequently interrupted by drought events, agriculture where crops and livestock suffer the impacts of drought and flooding and increasing occurrences of epidemics from pests and diseases in the health sector. In general, more than 70% of natural disasters in Tanzania are climate related. They are linked to droughts and floods and these have become more frequent as a result of climate change and climate variability. Several studies conducted in various regions and districts in the United Republic of Tanzania, indicate that rural areas especially agro-pastoral communities have been experiencing the effect of climate change through crop failures, decreased crop yields, increased water scarcity and sometimes shrinkage and drying of grazing lands/pastures due to increased and intensified drought periods. The predominance of more bad years as commonly referred by communities in rural areas of Tanzania have negatively impacted farmers‘ livelihoods, their economies and social life. In Kongwa district for example, worryingly, farmers are reporting that both the timing of rainy seasons and the pattern of rains within seasons are changing. These observations of change in climate are striking in that they are widespread throughout the district and are pronounced in remarkably consistent terms in almost all villages of the district. ",,

However, in the last five years, basin-wide floods with high water depths, taking several days to subside, have been occurring almost annually. These floods cause major disruption to the productive sector and the populated centers, and frequently result in loss of personal property. Losses are estimated at between USD 19 – 36 million per year at the country level, depending on the climate scenario. Climate change will exacerbate the problems that currently exist in the basin, with the confluence of various economic activities in the same territory (agriculture, fishing, commercial, oil and gas production), the poor condition of the drainage systems, and the pressures of major urban growth in the area in recent years. The riverine system is especially susceptible to the effects of climate change, including the threats of saline intrusion which affects both flora and fauna. The SORB area has been prioritized by the country because of the chronic flooding issues that occur even in periods of moderate rainfall, it is a region of high population density and agricultural and commercial activity, and thus disruption and economic losses are significant. This project aims to increase the resilience of the South Oropouche River Basin’s population and ecosystems to flooding, sea level rise and expected increasing water deficit events. The proposed activities will strengthen territorial planning and risk management, will promote investments for enhancing water infrastructure, EbA measures in vulnerable and coastal ecosystems, increase the adaptive capacity of vulnerable farmers and fisherfolk to diversify and strengthened their livelihoods, and raise awareness, build capacities, and mobilize the stakeholders of the SORB towards climate change resilient actions that account for gender justice. The expected total number of beneficiaries sums up to 197,540 beneficiaries, since some of the expected investments such as the expanded hydrometeorological information network and improved flood emergency response plans, which will incorporate the information of developed flood risks maps will indirectly benefit the whole basin population. In terms of direct support to increase adaptation capacities with direct adaptation concrete solutions or capacity building, the Project will reach 9,758 community members, being 50,1% women. Furthermore 679 people will avoid a decrease in income due to the diversified livelihood options supported by the Project. Additionally with the intervention 175 ha. of key coastal and wetland ecosystems in the Godineau Swamp will be rehabilitated coupled with 17.5 ha which will be improved due to sustainable production practices.

Mpologoma catchment covers 7,862 square kilometres of land area and 1,127 square kilometres of water area. The catchment is also characterized by a variety of ecosystems such as wetlands, farmlands, bush land, and forest land. Mpologoma catchment is reportedly experiencing more erratic and unpredictable rainfalls, both in amount, duration, and intensity in recent years all attributed to climate change. The main drivers for climate change vulnerability in Mpologoma catchment is high population growth, over dependence on unsustainable rain-fed agriculture and on natural resources, and inadequate options for alternative incomes. The human population in Mpologoma catchment is susceptible to water and sanitation related diseases due to floods and landslides aggravated by limited, unsustainable and unreliable Flood Early Warning systems and strategies. This project intends to build on the existing initiatives of Water Aid Uganda (WAU) in Eastern Uganda and undertake new interventions aimed at building the resilience of communities to climate change. The project will focus on strengthening institutional capacity for planning, designing, implementing and monitoring integrated Flood Early Warning systems (FEWS) and climate-smart WASH technologies. The project will be implemented in different sites upstream, midstream and downstream areas within Mpologoma catchment. These sites are considered to be most vulnerable and prone to floods and landslides and to climate change impacts. The overall goal of the project is to increase the resilience of communities to climate change risks of floods and landslides through timely response to climate hazards, sustainable community access to water, sanitation and hygiene services and integrated catchment management measures in Mpologoma catchment. The project aims to benefit 40,933 individuals and enhance 12 Early Warning Systems.    ",,

Along with the water resource management and coastal erosion issues, the lack of vertical and horizontal coordination has been bottlenecked for the community to reflect their needs to the provincial and national level policies. In the Mekong Delta, river water and ground water levels are decreasing, while sea levels, flood tides and salt intrusion are on the rise, the demand for water has also increased in production and daily activities due to industrialisation and population growth. The extraction of groundwater has increased rapidly over the past decades and forms one of the main causes of saltwater intrusion into the groundwater. This intrusion has been accelerated by the on-going sea level rise. Saltwater intrusion of groundwater in the Mekong Delta is a highly complex issue as it heavily depends on varying factors, including changes in water supplies, rising water demands, and the impact of climate change especially sea level rise, drought, and rising temperature. Because of saltwater intrusion of the groundwater, a growing number of provinces in the Mekong Delta are also experiencing depleted and degraded freshwater supplies for drinking and domestic use especially in dry season.

As a result, water sources often dry up during the September to November dry season, causing the failure of crops and animal productive systems during this period. The largest burden of this water insecurity is put on women and particularly girls, as they are forced to miss out on other crucial opportunities, such as education, when having to walk for more than 10km to fetch water. Even during the rainfall season, the precipitation that is received is very limited (<400 mm) and unreliable, therefore strategies are required to improve and protect livelihoods in periods with little or no rainfall. Due to limited adaptation options, an increase in unsustainable activities along key value chains is observed, leading to land degradation and deterioration of key water sources. Poor land husbandry practices have degraded crucial water resources systems such as wetlands and natural sand dams, which are incrementally reducing their ability to provide ecosystem services. The other challenge, as in most poor areas in Zimbabwe, is related to poor value chains. Some business ventures such as beekeeping and goat rearing have not been successful because of the limited scale of the projects and disorganized markets. These challenges are happening in a space where there is a weak institutional framework for farmers to participate viably in priority value chains, with weak adaptive capacities among the smallholder communities and low application of climate smart technologies. To address several of these challenges, this Project aims to increase local communities’ adaptive capacity and resilience to climate change through sustainable groundwater utilisation for food security and other productive uses in rural areas of Zimbabwe. To achieve this, an array of actions are required starting at national to local levels and involving institutional reforms and modelling, characterisation and quantification of the groundwater resources, knowledge generation and capacity development, and awareness raising through piloting and demonstration.
